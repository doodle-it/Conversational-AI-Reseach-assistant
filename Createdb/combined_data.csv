the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as
an increasingly important component of overall nondestructive
evaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for
implementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft
components, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,
there have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in
actual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air
force, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the
federal aviation administration, nasa and the department of
transportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-
mon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-
tial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples
include the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-
ite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical
plants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers.
successful field implementation of shm has not been widely
achieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-
ing the development and demonstration of shm sensors that
have long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-
ty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of
flaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into
structural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing
number of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-
tion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy
and air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these
issues.[1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-
tion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-
tion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;
significantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new
as well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures.
defining structural health monitoring
shm has been defined differently by various research groups. for
instance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect
and interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve
reliability and reduce life cycle costs.[2, 3] the greatest challenge
in designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look
for and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a
particular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of
the shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,
will dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn
determines the requirements for the rest of the components in the
system. much current research focuses on the relationship
between various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a
structure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-
uous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-
tion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors
with minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural
integrity of the structure.”[4] shm includes all monitoring
aspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc., which have a
direct influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result
from fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-
ditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-
tems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and
adequate computational models of the structure.
for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for
future aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-
nance concepts but will have a significant influence on design
concepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one
of the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of
future aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving
benefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-
tion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-
ponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-
ation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,
which would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry.
emerging shm technologies
the foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to
monitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive
evaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the
structure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant
advances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have
developed the hardware and software needed for analysis and
communication of the shm results.
the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree
of maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of
structures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive
acoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been
shown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-
trically conducting materials.
fiber optic sensors
a 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-
ing (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation
of the complex physical principals underlying these sensors.[5]
fiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit
light through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a
structure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the
laser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-
tion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in

turn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-
al years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d
and commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg
sensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-
posite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the
composite during its manufacture.
japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-
ing fiber optic sensors systems for shm.[6-9] perhaps the most
interesting work involved the study of the application of both
surface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to
full-scale monitoring of large composite structures.[9] the
authors monitored strain or temperature during composite
manufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance.
the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied
were international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a
japanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both
cases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-
ature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and
temperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their
work demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed
sensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage
of the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and
strain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent
structural testing.
passive acoustic emission sensors
acoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the
ultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo
cracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-
tion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure
can be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a
structure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,
either attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be
used to detect acoustic emission signals.
as an example of the broad research and development of
acoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously
active fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in
composite materials.[10] active fiber composite (afc) materials
were a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s
and further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)
for use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured
and fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain
levels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a
tremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-
nels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases
the chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic
emission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic
emission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient
distribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of
afc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was
modeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these
sensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by
the researchers.
the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect
actual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to
failure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-
ventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-
ducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and
greatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency.
active ultrasonic sensors
research on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a
great deal of attention over the last several years with researchers
from several countries, including the united states, the united
kingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the
literature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use
of ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-
ical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors.
as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic
patch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was
studied.[11] the researchers studied the optimization materials
and configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-
retical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate
the capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-
ed that they were able to greatly improve the performance of
this class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-
opment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced
sensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a
very good technique for shm of composites, and they will be
used in future field applications.
as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the
changes in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers

as a function of damage in structures.[12] physical changes in
the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure.
figure 3 shows the interac-
tion between a piezoelectric
transducer and its host struc-
ture as described in a simple
one-dimensional model.
the research concluded
that the effectiveness of sen-
sors for shm using changes
in the electrical impedance of
piezoelectric transducers was
successfully demonstrated.
selected shm examples
in this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a
variety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and
aerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad
systems.
several interesting examples of shm applications have been
reported recently.[13] these applications are based on significant
advances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor
technology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic
strain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with
optical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an
increasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple
fbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing
(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique
optoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide
operating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their
full range, on a single fiber.
in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft.[13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike
tests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike
demonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage
electrical pulses.
another shm example involves application to offshore oil
drilling operations.[13] in deep water operations, tidal currents
can cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring
the oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations
induce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue
failure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a
6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to
help predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve
this result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half
section tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a
way as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical
fiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both
edges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system
was able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser
pipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted
to the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using
an electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully
deployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of
mexico, and it has been in
operation for many months.
the use of ultrasonic trans-
ducers to monitor railroad
wheels for cracks has also
been investigated.[14] the
ultrasonic signal is intro-
duced by the high speed con-
tact of the steel railroad
wheel to the steel track, and
the signal is detected by a
pzt transducer placed
inside the hollow shaft of the
wheel axle. the transducer is
configured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the
rapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a
wireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-
puter. after development, the shm system was checked on a
railroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable
of operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects
cracks in the wheels.
to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle
thermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-
ing impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the
shuttle’s wing leading edge was developed.[15] in addition, a
large effort was described that focused on understanding the
damage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading
edge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to
assess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were
installed between flights.
the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the
rcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high
resolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,
acoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array
scanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-
bility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the
shuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space
center (ksc).
the development of a first generation impact sensing system
for the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this
system is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and
ablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of
detecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital
debris impacts during flight. the shm system was based
on wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been
qualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this
accelerometer based shm system is now used on all space
shuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the
shuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]
conclusions and prognosis
over the past decade there has been an impressive research and
development contribution to the knowledge base required for
structural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern
paradigm of nondestructive evaluation. this modern nde

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement.
the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e.g., temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm.
to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity.

as a function of damage in structures.[12] physical changes in
the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure.

tion between a piezoelectric

successfully demonstrated.
selected shm examples
in this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a
variety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and
aerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad
systems.
several interesting examples of shm applications have been
reported recently.[13] these applications are based on significant
advances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor
technology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic
strain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with
optical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an
increasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple
fbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing
(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique
optoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide
operating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their
full range, on a single fiber.
in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft.[13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike
tests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike
demonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage
electrical pulses.
another shm example involves application to offshore oil
drilling operations.[13] in deep water operations, tidal currents
can cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring
the oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations
induce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue
failure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a
6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to
help predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve
this result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half
section tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a
way as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical
fiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both
edges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system
was able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser
pipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted
to the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using
an electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully
deployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of
mexico, and it has been in
operation for many months.
the use of ultrasonic trans-
ducers to monitor railroad
wheels for cracks has also
been investigated.[14] the
ultrasonic signal is intro-
duced by the high speed con-
tact of the steel railroad
wheel to the steel track, and
the signal is detected by a
pzt transducer placed
inside the hollow shaft of the
wheel axle. the transducer is
configured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the
rapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a
wireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-
puter. after development, the shm system was checked on a
railroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable
of operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects
cracks in the wheels.
to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle
thermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-
ing impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the
shuttle’s wing leading edge was developed.[15] in addition, a
large effort was described that focused on understanding the
damage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading
edge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to
assess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were
installed between flights.
the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the
rcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high
resolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,
acoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array
scanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-
bility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the
shuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space
center (ksc).
the development of a first generation impact sensing system
for the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this
system is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and
ablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of
detecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital
debris impacts during flight. the shm system was based
on wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been
qualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this
accelerometer based shm system is now used on all space
shuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the
shuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]

development contribution to the knowledge base required for

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement.
the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e.g., temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm.
to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity.

the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as
an increasingly important component of overall nondestructive
evaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for
implementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft
components, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,
there have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in
actual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air
force, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the
federal aviation administration, nasa and the department of
transportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-
mon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-
tial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples
include the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-
ite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical
plants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers.
successful field implementation of shm has not been widely
achieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-
ing the development and demonstration of shm sensors that
have long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-
ty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of
flaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into
structural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing
number of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-
tion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy
and air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these
issues.[1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-
tion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-
tion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;
significantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new
as well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures.
defining structural health monitoring
shm has been defined differently by various research groups. for
instance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect
and interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve
reliability and reduce life cycle costs.[2, 3] the greatest challenge
in designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look
for and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a
particular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of
the shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,
will dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn
determines the requirements for the rest of the components in the
system. much current research focuses on the relationship
between various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a
structure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-
uous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-
tion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors
with minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural
integrity of the structure.”[4] shm includes all monitoring
aspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc., which have a
direct influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result
from fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-
ditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-
tems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and
adequate computational models of the structure.
for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for
future aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-
nance concepts but will have a significant influence on design
concepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one
of the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of
future aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving
benefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-
tion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-
ponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-
ation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,
which would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry.
emerging shm technologies
the foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to
monitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive
evaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the
structure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant
advances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have
developed the hardware and software needed for analysis and
communication of the shm results.
the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree
of maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of
structures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive
acoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been
shown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-
trically conducting materials.
fiber optic sensors
a 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-
ing (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation
of the complex physical principals underlying these sensors.[5]
fiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit
light through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a
structure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the
laser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-
tion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in

turn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-
al years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d
and commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg
sensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-
posite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the
composite during its manufacture.
japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-
ing fiber optic sensors systems for shm.[6-9] perhaps the most
interesting work involved the study of the application of both
surface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to
full-scale monitoring of large composite structures.[9] the
authors monitored strain or temperature during composite
manufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance.
the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied
were international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a
japanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both
cases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-
ature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and
temperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their
work demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed
sensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage
of the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and
strain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent
structural testing.
passive acoustic emission sensors
acoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the
ultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo
cracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-
tion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure
can be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a
structure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,
either attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be
used to detect acoustic emission signals.
as an example of the broad research and development of
acoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously
active fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in
composite materials.[10] active fiber composite (afc) materials
were a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s
and further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)
for use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured
and fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain
levels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a
tremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-
nels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases
the chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic
emission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic
emission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient
distribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of
afc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was
modeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these
sensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by
the researchers.
the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect
actual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to
failure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-
ventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-
ducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and
greatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency.
active ultrasonic sensors
research on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a
great deal of attention over the last several years with researchers
from several countries, including the united states, the united
kingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the
literature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use
of ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-
ical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors.
as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic
patch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was
studied.[11] the researchers studied the optimization materials
and configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-
retical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate
the capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-
ed that they were able to greatly improve the performance of
this class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-
opment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced
sensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a
very good technique for shm of composites, and they will be
used in future field applications.
as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the
changes in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers

the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure.

full range, on a single fiber.
in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft.[13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike

the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as
an increasingly important component of overall nondestructive
evaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for
implementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft
components, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,
there have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in
actual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air
force, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the
federal aviation administration, nasa and the department of
transportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-
mon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-
tial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples
include the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-
ite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical
plants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers.
successful field implementation of shm has not been widely
achieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-
ing the development and demonstration of shm sensors that
have long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-
ty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of
flaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into
structural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing
number of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-
tion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy
and air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these
issues.[1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-
tion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-
tion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;
significantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new
as well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures.
defining structural health monitoring
shm has been defined differently by various research groups. for
instance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect
and interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve
reliability and reduce life cycle costs.[2, 3] the greatest challenge
in designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look
for and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a
particular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of
the shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,
will dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn
determines the requirements for the rest of the components in the
system. much current research focuses on the relationship
between various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a
structure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-
uous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-
tion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors
with minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural
integrity of the structure.”[4] shm includes all monitoring
aspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc., which have a
direct influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result
from fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-
ditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-
tems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and
adequate computational models of the structure.
for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for
future aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-
nance concepts but will have a significant influence on design
concepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one
of the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of
future aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving
benefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-
tion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-
ponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-
ation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,
which would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry.
emerging shm technologies
the foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to
monitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive
evaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the
structure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant
advances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have
developed the hardware and software needed for analysis and
communication of the shm results.
the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree
of maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of
structures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive
acoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been
shown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-
trically conducting materials.
fiber optic sensors
a 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-
ing (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation
of the complex physical principals underlying these sensors.[5]
fiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit
light through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a
structure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the
laser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-
tion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in

turn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-
al years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d
and commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg
sensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-
posite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the
composite during its manufacture.
japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-
ing fiber optic sensors systems for shm.[6-9] perhaps the most
interesting work involved the study of the application of both
surface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to
full-scale monitoring of large composite structures.[9] the
authors monitored strain or temperature during composite
manufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance.
the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied
were international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a
japanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both
cases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-
ature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and
temperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their
work demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed
sensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage
of the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and
strain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent
structural testing.
passive acoustic emission sensors
acoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the
ultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo
cracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-
tion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure
can be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a
structure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,
either attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be
used to detect acoustic emission signals.
as an example of the broad research and development of
acoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously
active fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in
composite materials.[10] active fiber composite (afc) materials
were a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s
and further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)
for use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured
and fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain
levels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a
tremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-
nels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases
the chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic
emission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic
emission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient
distribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of
afc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was
modeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these
sensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by
the researchers.
the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect
actual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to
failure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-
ventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-
ducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and
greatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency.
active ultrasonic sensors
research on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a
great deal of attention over the last several years with researchers
from several countries, including the united states, the united
kingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the
literature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use
of ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-
ical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors.
as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic
patch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was
studied.[11] the researchers studied the optimization materials
and configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-
retical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate
the capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-
ed that they were able to greatly improve the performance of
this class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-
opment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced
sensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a
very good technique for shm of composites, and they will be
used in future field applications.
as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the
changes in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers

as a function of damage in structures.[12] physical changes in
the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure.
figure 3 shows the interac-
tion between a piezoelectric
transducer and its host struc-
ture as described in a simple
one-dimensional model.
the research concluded
that the effectiveness of sen-
sors for shm using changes
in the electrical impedance of
piezoelectric transducers was
successfully demonstrated.
selected shm examples
in this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a
variety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and
aerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad
systems.
several interesting examples of shm applications have been
reported recently.[13] these applications are based on significant
advances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor
technology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic
strain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with
optical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an
increasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple
fbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing
(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique
optoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide
operating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their
full range, on a single fiber.
in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft.[13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike
tests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike
demonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage
electrical pulses.
another shm example involves application to offshore oil
drilling operations.[13] in deep water operations, tidal currents
can cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring
the oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations
induce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue
failure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a
6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to
help predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve
this result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half
section tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a
way as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical
fiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both
edges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system
was able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser
pipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted
to the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using
an electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully
deployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of
mexico, and it has been in
operation for many months.
the use of ultrasonic trans-
ducers to monitor railroad
wheels for cracks has also
been investigated.[14] the
ultrasonic signal is intro-
duced by the high speed con-
tact of the steel railroad
wheel to the steel track, and
the signal is detected by a
pzt transducer placed
inside the hollow shaft of the
wheel axle. the transducer is
configured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the
rapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a
wireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-
puter. after development, the shm system was checked on a
railroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable
of operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects
cracks in the wheels.
to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle
thermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-
ing impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the
shuttle’s wing leading edge was developed.[15] in addition, a
large effort was described that focused on understanding the
damage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading
edge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to
assess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were
installed between flights.
the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the
rcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high
resolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,
acoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array
scanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-
bility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the
shuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space
center (ksc).
the development of a first generation impact sensing system
for the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this
system is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and
ablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of
detecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital
debris impacts during flight. the shm system was based
on wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been
qualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this
accelerometer based shm system is now used on all space
shuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the
shuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]
conclusions and prognosis
over the past decade there has been an impressive research and
development contribution to the knowledge base required for
structural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern
paradigm of nondestructive evaluation. this modern nde

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement.
the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e.g., temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm.
to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity.

the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as
an increasingly important component of overall nondestructive
evaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for
implementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft
components, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,
there have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in
actual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air
force, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the
federal aviation administration, nasa and the department of
transportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-
mon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-
tial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples
include the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-
ite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical
plants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers.
successful field implementation of shm has not been widely
achieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-
ing the development and demonstration of shm sensors that
have long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-
ty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of
flaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into
structural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing
number of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-
tion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy
and air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these
issues.[1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-
tion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-
tion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;
significantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new
as well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures.
defining structural health monitoring
shm has been defined differently by various research groups. for
instance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect
and interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve
reliability and reduce life cycle costs.[2, 3] the greatest challenge
in designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look
for and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a
particular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of
the shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,
will dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn
determines the requirements for the rest of the components in the
system. much current research focuses on the relationship
between various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a
structure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-
uous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-
tion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors
with minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural
integrity of the structure.”[4] shm includes all monitoring
aspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc., which have a
direct influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result
from fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-
ditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-
tems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and
adequate computational models of the structure.
for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for
future aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-
nance concepts but will have a significant influence on design
concepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one
of the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of
future aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving
benefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-
tion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-
ponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-
ation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,
which would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry.
emerging shm technologies
the foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to
monitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive
evaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the
structure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant
advances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have
developed the hardware and software needed for analysis and
communication of the shm results.
the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree
of maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of
structures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive
acoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been
shown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-
trically conducting materials.
fiber optic sensors
a 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-
ing (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation
of the complex physical principals underlying these sensors.[5]
fiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit
light through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a
structure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the
laser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-
tion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in

turn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-
al years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d
and commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg
sensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-
posite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the
composite during its manufacture.
japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-
ing fiber optic sensors systems for shm.[6-9] perhaps the most
interesting work involved the study of the application of both
surface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to
full-scale monitoring of large composite structures.[9] the
authors monitored strain or temperature during composite
manufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance.
the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied
were international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a
japanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both
cases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-
ature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and
temperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their
work demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed
sensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage
of the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and
strain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent
structural testing.
passive acoustic emission sensors
acoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the
ultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo
cracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-
tion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure
can be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a
structure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,
either attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be
used to detect acoustic emission signals.
as an example of the broad research and development of
acoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously
active fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in
composite materials.[10] active fiber composite (afc) materials
were a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s
and further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)
for use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured
and fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain
levels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a
tremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-
nels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases
the chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic
emission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic
emission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient
distribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of
afc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was
modeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these
sensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by
the researchers.
the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect
actual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to
failure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-
ventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-
ducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and
greatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency.
active ultrasonic sensors
research on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a
great deal of attention over the last several years with researchers
from several countries, including the united states, the united
kingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the
literature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use
of ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-
ical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors.
as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic
patch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was
studied.[11] the researchers studied the optimization materials
and configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-
retical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate
the capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-
ed that they were able to greatly improve the performance of
this class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-
opment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced
sensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a
very good technique for shm of composites, and they will be
used in future field applications.
as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the
changes in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers

as a function of damage in structures.[12] physical changes in
the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure.
figure 3 shows the interac-
tion between a piezoelectric
transducer and its host struc-
ture as described in a simple
one-dimensional model.
the research concluded
that the effectiveness of sen-
sors for shm using changes
in the electrical impedance of
piezoelectric transducers was
successfully demonstrated.
selected shm examples
in this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a
variety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and
aerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad
systems.
several interesting examples of shm applications have been
reported recently.[13] these applications are based on significant
advances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor
technology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic
strain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with
optical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an
increasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple
fbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing
(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique
optoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide
operating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their
full range, on a single fiber.
in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft.[13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike
tests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike
demonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage
electrical pulses.
another shm example involves application to offshore oil
drilling operations.[13] in deep water operations, tidal currents
can cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring
the oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations
induce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue
failure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a
6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to
help predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve
this result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half
section tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a
way as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical
fiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both
edges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system
was able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser
pipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted
to the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using
an electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully
deployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of
mexico, and it has been in
operation for many months.
the use of ultrasonic trans-
ducers to monitor railroad
wheels for cracks has also
been investigated.[14] the
ultrasonic signal is intro-
duced by the high speed con-
tact of the steel railroad
wheel to the steel track, and
the signal is detected by a
pzt transducer placed
inside the hollow shaft of the
wheel axle. the transducer is
configured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the
rapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a
wireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-
puter. after development, the shm system was checked on a
railroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable
of operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects
cracks in the wheels.
to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle
thermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-
ing impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the
shuttle’s wing leading edge was developed.[15] in addition, a
large effort was described that focused on understanding the
damage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading
edge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to
assess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were
installed between flights.
the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the
rcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high
resolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,
acoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array
scanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-
bility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the
shuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space
center (ksc).
the development of a first generation impact sensing system
for the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this
system is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and
ablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of
detecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital
debris impacts during flight. the shm system was based
on wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been
qualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this
accelerometer based shm system is now used on all space
shuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the
shuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]
conclusions and prognosis
over the past decade there has been an impressive research and
development contribution to the knowledge base required for
structural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern
paradigm of nondestructive evaluation. this modern nde

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement.
the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e.g., temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm.
to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity.

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement.
the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e.g., temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm.
to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity.

shm has been defined differently by various research groups. for
instance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect
and interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve
reliability and reduce life cycle costs. [2, 3] the greatest challenge
in designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look
for and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a

the shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,
will dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn
determines the requirements for the rest of the components in the

between various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a

tion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors
with minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural
integrity of the structure. ”[4] shm includes all monitoring
aspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc. , which have a
direct influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result
from fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-

the foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to

sensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-
posite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the
composite during its manufacture. japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-
ing fiber optic sensors systems for shm. [6-9] perhaps the most
interesting work involved the study of the application of both
surface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to
full-scale monitoring of large composite structures. [9] the
authors monitored strain or temperature during composite
manufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance. the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied
were international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a
japanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both
cases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-

work demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed
sensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage
of the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and
strain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent
structural testing. passive acoustic emission sensors
acoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the
ultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo
cracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-
tion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure
can be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a
structure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,
either attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be
used to detect acoustic emission signals. as an example of the broad research and development of
acoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously
active fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in
composite materials. [10] active fiber composite (afc) materials
were a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s
and further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)
for use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured
and fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain
levels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a
tremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-
nels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases
the chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic
emission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic
emission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient
distribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of
afc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was
modeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these
sensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by
the researchers. the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect
actual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to
failure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-
ventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-
ducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and
greatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency. active ultrasonic sensors
research on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a
great deal of attention over the last several years with researchers
from several countries, including the united states, the united
kingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the
literature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use
of ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-
ical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors. as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic
patch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was
studied. [11] the researchers studied the optimization materials
and configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-
retical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate
the capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-
ed that they were able to greatly improve the performance of
this class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-
opment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced
sensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a
very good technique for shm of composites, and they will be
used in future field applications. as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the
changes in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers

as a function of damage in structures. [12] physical changes in
the structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of
the structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-
mechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either
bonded to the surface or
embedded in the structure. figure 3 shows the interac-
tion between a piezoelectric
transducer and its host struc-
ture as described in a simple
one-dimensional model. the research concluded
that the effectiveness of sen-
sors for shm using changes
in the electrical impedance of
piezoelectric transducers was
successfully demonstrated. selected shm examples
in this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a
variety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and
aerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad
systems. several interesting examples of shm applications have been
reported recently. [13] these applications are based on significant
advances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor
technology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic
strain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with
optical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an
increasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple
fbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing
(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique
optoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide
operating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their
full range, on a single fiber. in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-
cal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-
ward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil
transport aircraft. [13] using the tdm interrogation system, the
fbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-
ing the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike
tests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike
demonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage
electrical pulses. another shm example involves application to offshore oil
drilling operations. [13] in deep water operations, tidal currents
can cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring
the oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations
induce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue
failure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a
6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to
help predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve
this result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half
section tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a
way as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical
fiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both
edges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system
was able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser
pipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted
to the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using
an electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully
deployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of
mexico, and it has been in
operation for many months. the use of ultrasonic trans-
ducers to monitor railroad
wheels for cracks has also
been investigated. [14] the
ultrasonic signal is intro-
duced by the high speed con-
tact of the steel railroad
wheel to the steel track, and
the signal is detected by a
pzt transducer placed
inside the hollow shaft of the
wheel axle. the transducer is
configured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the
rapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a
wireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-
puter. after development, the shm system was checked on a
railroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable
of operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects
cracks in the wheels. to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle
thermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-
ing impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the
shuttle’s wing leading edge was developed. [15] in addition, a
large effort was described that focused on understanding the
damage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading
edge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to
assess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were
installed between flights. the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the
rcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high
resolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,
acoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array
scanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-
bility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the
shuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space
center (ksc). the development of a first generation impact sensing system
for the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this
system is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and
ablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of
detecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital
debris impacts during flight. the shm system was based
on wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been
qualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this
accelerometer based shm system is now used on all space
shuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the
shuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]
conclusions and prognosis
over the past decade there has been an impressive research and
development contribution to the knowledge base required for
structural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern
paradigm of nondestructive evaluation. c

paradigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life
cycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,
nde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-
facturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-
service inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly
more expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the
name of structural health monitoring to include also functional
health monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components
and systems have more than just a mechanical structural
requirement. the shm research and development base has now reached a
modest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,
active ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active
mechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,
and wireless communications between sensors and a central
station. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern
nde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-
digm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:
• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors
embedded or attached to structures, including environmental
effects (e. , temperature) on the sensors;
• development of quantitative information in the form of
pod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems
in a variety of applications, including the need for viable
calibration standards and techniques;
• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-
tures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period
of time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems
with integration of results into structural/platform mainte-
nance strategies;
• development and promulgation of standards covering the
standard practices needed for the widespread application of
shm. to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do
not have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps
in parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving
shm r&d into useful application will require a commitment
on the part of both shm technology developers and potential
users of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-
cation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs
associated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the
cost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use
is often the case rather than a rarity."

the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

to the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

zðxþ and z(x) are the dynamic stiffness matrices
of the damaged and undamaged structure, respectively.
the vectors ~a lðxþ and a l(x) are the lth column of

with dzðxþ ¼
e
zðxþ (cid:4) zðxþ. the right-hand side of this
expression is ill-conditioned [19] and, therefore, one
must pre-multiply both sides of eq. (8) by a(x):

expression (16) defines a set of ng linear equations,
with n unknowns. if one considers nf excitation fre-
quencies the number of equations increases to m =
ng · nf. in compact form, expression (16) is written as
sdb ¼ da: ð17þ
one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-
ferent dof, leading to m = ng · nf · ne equations.
however, in the present work, only one single-input unit
force f
l
was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.
the least-squares solution of (17) is given by,
db ¼
ðst sþ(cid:4)1 st
da ¼
sþ
da; ð18þ
where
s+
is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

j ea ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþj
j ea ilðx kþj þ ja ilðx kþj
6
d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼
1
nt
xnt
t¼1
ei
t

dme
6

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1
nf

eii
p

fae
6
1; ð22þ
where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

an element is taken as damaged if

re the better the results. the first two indicators classify
the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.

the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]

stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,

the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes.
fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

frequency ranges [50, 1000] hz and [1100–1900] hz.
note that in both cases there are m = 20202 equations.
one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth
damage case with both frequency ranges. the result with
the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.
3.2.3. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

abstract
a damage identification technique based on frequency response functions (frf) sensitivities is presented. this technique leads to
a set of linear equations, which is solved using an algorithm that constrains the solution to be physically admissible. damage sim-
ulation and identification on a laminated rectangular plate is performed. the influence of the number of natural frequencies and
mode shapes used on the frf computation, as well as the frequency range, the excitation location and the number of measured
degrees of freedom (m-dof) is studied. numerical tests show that the best accuracy is obtained when using the dynamic expansion
of the m-dof. it is also demonstrated that for small damage the errors are the main influence, whereas for large damage the model
incompleteness becomes the most important factor in the results. a procedure for weighting and deletion of equations is used to
obtain better identification results. the results of the technique presented in this paper versus those obtained by a technique based
on modal data is also discussed.

obtain better identification results. the results of the technique presented in this paper versus those obtained by a technique based
on modal data is also discussed.

1. ","
the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

to the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

matrices q and dx have dimensions ng · n and

but a rank of n. note that the structure has no damping.

to the lth dof of both the undamaged and damaged
structure one gets

¼ zðxþa lðxþ; ð7þ
where
e
zðxþ and z(x) are the dynamic stiffness matrices
of the damaged and undamaged structure, respectively.
the vectors ~a lðxþ and a l(x) are the lth column of
e

the above equation can be written as
dzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ f

with dzðxþ ¼
e
zðxþ (cid:4) zðxþ. the right-hand side of this
expression is ill-conditioned [19] and, therefore, one
must pre-multiply both sides of eq. (8) by a(x):
aðxþdzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ a lðxþ (cid:4) ~a lðxþ: ð9þ
note that f

is the lth column of the identity matrix. the

expression (16) defines a set of ng linear equations,
with n unknowns. if one considers nf excitation fre-
quencies the number of equations increases to m =
ng · nf. in compact form, expression (16) is written as
sdb ¼ da: ð17þ
one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-
ferent dof, leading to m = ng · nf · ne equations.
however, in the present work, only one single-input unit
force f
l
was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.
the least-squares solution of (17) is given by,
db ¼
ðst sþ(cid:4)1 st
da ¼
sþ
da; ð18þ
where
s+
is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

j ea ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþj
j ea ilðx kþj þ ja ilðx kþj
6
d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼
1
nt
xnt
t¼1
ei
t

6
dme
6

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1
nf
xnf
p¼1
eii
p

6
fae
6
1; ð22þ
where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

re the better the results. the first two indicators classify
the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.

the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]

stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.
the damage was simulated in 16 elements (fig. 1).

ulated cases are shown in table 2, where is also pre-

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,

the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes.
fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth

the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.
3.2.3. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

to the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

2.2. frf sensitivities
considering that a single-input unit force f

is applied
to the lth dof of both the undamaged and damaged
structure one gets
e
zðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ f
l
¼ zðxþa lðxþ; ð7þ
where
e
zðxþ and z(x) are the dynamic stiffness matrices
of the damaged and undamaged structure, respectively.
the vectors ~a lðxþ and a l(x) are the lth column of
e
aðxþ and a(x), respectively.
the above equation can be written as
dzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ f
l
(cid:4) zðxþ~a lðxþ; ð8þ
with dzðxþ ¼
e
zðxþ (cid:4) zðxþ. the right-hand side of this
expression is ill-conditioned [19] and, therefore, one
must pre-multiply both sides of eq. (8) by a(x):
aðxþdzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ a lðxþ (cid:4) ~a lðxþ: ð9þ
note that f
l
is the lth column of the identity matrix. the
right-hand side of eq. (9) is the difference between the
undamaged and damaged structure frf.

expression (16) defines a set of ng linear equations,
with n unknowns. if one considers nf excitation fre-
quencies the number of equations increases to m =
ng · nf. in compact form, expression (16) is written as
sdb ¼ da: ð17þ
one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-
ferent dof, leading to m = ng · nf · ne equations.
however, in the present work, only one single-input unit
force f
l
was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.
the least-squares solution of (17) is given by,
db ¼
ðst sþ(cid:4)1 st
da ¼
sþ
da; ð18þ
where
s+
is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

j ea ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþj
j ea ilðx kþj þ ja ilðx kþj
6
d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼
1
nt
xnt
t¼1
ei
t

dme
6

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1
nf
xnf
p¼1
eii
p

6
fae
6

where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

an element is taken as damaged if

re the better the results. the first two indicators classify
the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.
3. applications
the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]
8
stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.
the damage was simulated in 16 elements (fig. 1).

ulated cases are shown in table 2, where is also pre-
sented the sum of the damage parameters, defined as

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,
156 and 49 transverse displacements m-dof. the black
dots in fig. 2 indicate the nodes where these displace-
ments are measured.
the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes.
fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

gree of damage with the absolute value of re for the

frequency ranges [50, 1000] hz and [1100–1900] hz.
note that in both cases there are m = 20202 equations.
one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth
damage case with both frequency ranges. the result with
the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.

in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

 the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

considering that a single-input unit force f

zðxþ and z(x) are the dynamic stiffness matrices
of the damaged and undamaged structure, respectively.
the vectors ~a lðxþ and a l(x) are the lth column of
e
aðxþ and a(x), respectively.
the above equation can be written as
dzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ f
l
(cid:4) zðxþ~a lðxþ; ð8þ
with dzðxþ ¼
e
zðxþ (cid:4) zðxþ. the right-hand side of this
expression is ill-conditioned [19] and, therefore, one
must pre-multiply both sides of eq. (8) by a(x):
aðxþdzðxþ~a lðxþ ¼ a lðxþ (cid:4) ~a lðxþ: ð9þ
note that f

is the lth column of the identity matrix. the
right-hand side of eq. (9) is the difference between the

expression (16) defines a set of ng linear equations,

one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-

however, in the present work, only one single-input unit

was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.

db ¼

where

is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼

nt
xnt

ei
t

dme

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1

fae

where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

re the better the results. the first two indicators classify
the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.
3. applications
the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]
8
stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.
the damage was simulated in 16 elements (fig. 1).

ulated cases are shown in table 2, where is also pre-
sented the sum of the damage parameters, defined as

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,
156 and 49 transverse displacements m-dof. the black
dots in fig. 2 indicate the nodes where these displace-
ments are measured.
the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes.
fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

gree of damage with the absolute value of re for the

frequency ranges [50, 1000] hz and [1100–1900] hz.
note that in both cases there are m = 20202 equations.
one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth
damage case with both frequency ranges. the result with
the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.
3.2.3. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

 the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-
ferent dof, leading to m = ng · nf · ne equations.
however, in the present work, only one single-input unit

was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.

db ¼

where

is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

j ea ilðx kþj þ ja ilðx kþj

d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼
1
nt
xnt
t¼1
ei
t

dme
6

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1
nf

eii
p

fae

where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.
3. applications
the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]
8
stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.
the damage was simulated in 16 elements (fig. 1).
the elements damage parameters of each of the five sim-
ulated cases are shown in table 2, where is also pre-
sented the sum of the damage parameters, defined as

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,
156 and 49 transverse displacements m-dof. the black
dots in fig. 2 indicate the nodes where these displace-
ments are measured.
the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes.
fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

gree of damage with the absolute value of re for the

frequency ranges [50, 1000] hz and [1100–1900] hz.
note that in both cases there are m = 20202 equations.
one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth
damage case with both frequency ranges. the result with
the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.
3.2.3. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

the damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage.
there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. a report by doebling et al. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. zou et al. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

 the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem.
the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. wang et al. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i.e., the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements.
a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account.
a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data
[12].

expression (16) defines a set of ng linear equations,
with n unknowns. if one considers nf excitation fre-
quencies the number of equations increases to m =
ng · nf. in compact form, expression (16) is written as
sdb ¼ da: ð17þ
one can use ne single-input unit forces applied to dif-
ferent dof, leading to m = ng · nf · ne equations.
however, in the present work, only one single-input unit
force f
l
was applied to the lth dof of both the undam-
aged and damaged structure.
the least-squares solution of (17) is given by,
db ¼
ðst sþ(cid:4)1 st
da ¼
sþ
da; ð18þ
where
s+
is the pseudo-inverse of s.
in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used.
the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12].
2.3. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j.v. arau´ jo dos santos et al. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20].
the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e.g. ~a ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþ). if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

j ea ilðx kþ (cid:4) a ilðx kþj
j ea ilðx kþj þ ja ilðx kþj
6
d for k ¼ 1; . . . ; nf ; ð19þ
where d 2 [0, 2]. when d = 0, no equation is deleted.
when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20].
besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7].
in ref. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12].
the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by
min ksdb ¼ dak

in other words, the solution is such that all the finite
elements are either undamaged (db
e
= 0) or with a posi-
tive quantity of damage (db
e
6
1). the solution vector
db obtained using the svd algorithm may contain ele-
ments with negative damage, i.e., elements with an in-
crease of stiffness.
2.4. damage identification accuracy indicators
in order to classify the accuracy of the results, some
indicators were used. the damage missing error is de-
fined as [23,24],
dme ¼
1
nt
xnt
t¼1
ei
t

dme
6

where nt is the number of true damaged elements and
ei
t
¼ 0 if the truly damaged element t is identified or
ei
t
¼ 1 otherwise. if dme = 0, then all true damaged ele-
ments are detected.
as a second accuracy indicator we chose the false
alarm error [23,24],
fae ¼
1
nf

eii
p

fae
6

where nf is the number of predicted damaged elements
and eii
p
¼ 0 if the predicted damaged element p is truly
damaged or eii
p
¼ 1 otherwise. if fae = 0, then all pre-
dicted damaged elements are truly damaged elements.
the mean sizing error [24] defines an average value of
the absolute discrepancies between the true damage
parameters

an element is taken as damaged if

re the better the results. the first two indicators classify
the results in terms of damage location, while the last
two are related to the damage quantification accuracy.
3. applications
the structure analysed is a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy rectangular plate, free in space, with a [0]
8
stack-
ing sequence. the material properties of the layers,
which have equal thicknesses, are presented in table 1.
the plate in-plane dimensions are shown in fig. 1 and
its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18].
therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the plate is free in space [25]. after the computation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, using a skyline
type assemblage of matrices and the subspace iteration
method [26], one uses expressions (1) and (4) to compute
the frf of the undamaged and damaged structure,
respectively.

four incomplete models were considered: 481, 325,

the results presented in this paper are relative to
three frequency ranges: (i) [50, 1000] hz; (ii)
[1100, 1900] hz and (iii) [50, 1900] hz. excitation fre-
quencies in a range ±20 hz from natural frequencies
are eliminated. this is done because it is likely that rel-
atively high levels of noise on the excitation signal at res-
onance be attained [27]. the excitation frequencies are
specified such that there is a spacing of 50 hz between
two consecutive excitation frequencies. this leads to a
total of 14 excitation frequencies for the first two fre-
quency ranges and 28 for the third frequency range.

3.1. complete models
3.1.1. without equations weighting or deletion
the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i.e., one knows all the ng dof.
the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3).
grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-

fig. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes.

frequency ranges [50, 1000] hz and [1100–1900] hz.
note that in both cases there are m = 20202 equations.
one can see that the best results are obtained with the
lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. fig. 5 shows the results for the fourth
damage case with both frequency ranges. the result with
the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). indeed, in
fig. 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker
columns) than in fig. 5(a).
the excitation location was also studied. table 5 pre-
sents the accuracy indicators relative to the application
of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. in
fig. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area.
in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations.
3.2. incomplete models
3.2.1. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i.e., they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations.
table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable.
in fig. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i.e., as the sum of the true damage parameters
kdbt
k
1
in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one.
3.2.2. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded.
the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions.

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone.
in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors.
3.2.3. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. (19). fig. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion
of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in the amplitudes of
m-dof. for d 2 [0.50, 1.95] the values of these indica-
tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of
d 2 [0.50, 1.95] present low values of fae and dme
(fig. 9(b)). these two indicators show a minimum for

d = 0.50. therefore, one can conclude that the best
value of d is 0.50. fig. 10 shows the identification results
in all elements for the third damage case, dynamic
expansion of 49 m-dof and 5.0% errors in amplitudes
of m-dof. in fig. 10(a) there are more false identified
elements away from the real damaged area than in
fig. 10(b). hence, the best results are in fact obtained
by weighting and deleting equations.
3.3. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations.
4. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest.
the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities.

damage identification in composites laminates is
of great importance, since, for example, delaminations
may not be detected by visual means and can cause cat-
astrophic failure if not detect in due time. one knows
that the occurrence of damage in structures modifies
some of its mass, stiffness and damping properties,
therefore changing the vibrational response of the struc-
ture. hence, the knowledge of the vibrational behaviour
of a structure can be used to determine the existence as
well as the location and extent of damage. there are two main types of damage detection tech-
niques: (i) non-parametric and (ii) parametric. the for-
mer detect damage using direct quantities such as
natural frequencies and mode shapes, frequency re-
sponse functions (frf), stiffness and flexibility matri-
ces. the latter use a set of parameters which define the
model of the structure and the assumed damage mecha-
nisms. several kinds of parameterizations may be em-
ployed. among them are sub-structural, physical and
geometric parameters, generic elements and stiffness
parameters. [1] surveys both
techniques, which are applied to several kind of struc-
tures. [2] present a review of vibration-based
model dependent techniques for the identification of
delaminations in composite structures. an important
class of parametric methods use sensitivity analysis of
modal data (natural frequencies and mode shapes)
[3–12] or frf data [13–15] to update structural models
or identify damage. in these techniques, the derivatives
of the data, namely natural frequencies, mode shapes
and frf, with respect to the physical parameters, lead

 the determination of a damage parameter vector. the
use of the frequency response model for damage identi-
fication leads to more equations than the use of the
modal model. hence, as the number of updating param-
eters or damage elements unknowns increases the frf
sensitivity techniques present better results. further-
more, the techniques based on modal data need modal
extraction, which leads to errors and omissions, and
the increased modal density at high frequencies can pose
a problem. the formulation of a parametric technique that uses
frf data, leading to a set of linear equations, was first
presented and applied to model updating by lin and
ewins [13]. these authors used replacement of unmeas-
ured degrees of freedom (u-dof) of the experimental
frf by their analytical counterparts and an iterative
process to solve the set of equations. [14]
used this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-
tural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay
frame structure. the results presented show false nega-
tive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),
since the unknown variables are not constrained. in case
of damage, there would be elements with only a decrease
in stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is
solved by constraining the variables to be physically
admissible, i. , the solution is such that there are no
false negative elements. a problem often encountered in this methods is the
model incompleteness of the damaged structure, because
the vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-
imentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of
freedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the
total number of undamaged structure degrees of free-
dom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-
ber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom
(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises
and other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always
contaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,
the problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two
methods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of
m-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]
and static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by
imposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of
the m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of
errors was also taken into account. a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which
is discretised using a first-order shear-deformation
theory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-
form the numerical tests. it is shown that the number
of natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the
frf computation, the frequency range and the exci-
tation location are important factors in the accu-
racy of the identification results. the results of the
technique presented in this paper are compared to
those obtained by a technique based on modal data

where

is the pseudo-inverse of s. in the above formulation it is implicit that one knows
all the dof of the damaged structure. however, that is
not possible to accomplish in practice, as, for instance,
rotational dof are very difficult to obtain experimen-
tally. consequently, the unknown degrees of freedom
(u-dof) of the damaged structure should be deter-
mined using an expansion of the measured degrees
of freedom (m-dof). to achieve this purpose, the
m-dof dynamic or static expansions may be used. the dynamic and static expansion processes are per-
formed as described in [12]. equations weighting, deletion and solving
the solution given by expression (18) depends not
only on the quality of measured frf data but also on
the weighting technique applied to the equations. this
weighting is needed because without it the least-squares
solution is dominated by the equations with the largest
coefficients. this means that the solution is dominated
by the equations defined at frequencies and locations
where the vibration response magnitudes are significant,
j. / composite structures 67 (2005) 239–249 241
overshadowing the information at other frequencies and
locations. therefore, one should consider all the fre-
quencies and locations. in this work, one multiplies both
sides of each equation by a scaling factor so that the sum
of coefficient squares in a resultant equation is unity
[20]. the vector da represents a subtraction between two
quantities (e. if the ith equation, rel-
ative to the kth frequency, has elements ~a ilðx kþ and
a il(x k) of similar magnitudes, the measurement error
may be significantly magnified after weighting. to over-
come this problem, such an equation should be re-
moved. one deletes the ith equation if [20]

d for k ¼ 1; . when d = 0, no equation is deleted. when d = 2, all the equations are deleted. the value
of the equations deletion parameter d should be chosen
in function of both error levels in the measured data and
amount of measured data. if the error levels are high
and the measured data are sufficient, a large d value
may be appropriate; if the errors levels are low and
the measured data are limited, a small d value should
be chosen [20]. besides the problem of finding reliable equations,
the physical admissible solution of eq. (17) is not always
obtained using algorithms such as the singular value
decompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7]. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-
posed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and
the bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the
authors have been using this last algorithm with success
in the damage identification using the sensitivities of
modal characteristics with model incompleteness and
errors [12]. the bvls algorithm leads to a solution defined by

its thickness is 3.385 mm. in order to compute the natu-
ral frequencies and mode shapes, the plate is discretised
in 12 · 12 finite elements based on the fsdt [18]. therefore, one has 144 unknowns. each element has
eight nodes, with three dof per node: one transverse
displacement and two rotations, yielding a total of 481
nodes and 1443 dof. a shift must be carried out, in
order to make the stiffness matrix positive definite, since

the following results were obtained with the knowl-
edge of all the dof of both undamaged and damaged
structure, i. the frf matrices accuracy greatly depend on the
number of natural frequencies and mode shapes used
in their computation (see section 2.1). indeed, the dam-
age identification results improve as the used number of
natural frequencies and mode shapes increases (table 3). grafe [28] showed that the response can sufficiently be
approximated by using a truncated number of frequen-
cies and mode shapes and proposed to use a truncated
modal solution of 2 · nm natural frequencies and mode
shapes to approximate the response matrix in the fre-
quency range that contains the first nm modes. attend-
ing to this, in the present case one can compute the
matrix a(x) and the vector ~a lðxþ with sufficient accu-
racy using m = n = 26, since there are 13 natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes in the frequency range
[50, 1900] hz. however, in view of the results in table
3, it is better to consider more than 3 · nm natural fre-
quencies and mode shapes. 3 shows the differences between receptances of
the undamaged structure computed with n = 10 and
n = 40. one sees that there is a relative superposition
of the curves for the range [0, 200] hz and the anti-reso-
nances decrease as the n increases. the values of the
resonances are much less affected by n. this behaviour
is in agreement with that found in the work of grafe
[28]. all the following damage identification results
are relative to a computation of frf with a truncated
modal solution of n = m = 40 frequencies and mode
shapes. 4 are presented the graphics relating the de-

lower frequency range. this corroborates the fact that
the receptances in the higher frequency range are com-
puted with less accuracy than those in the lower fre-
quency range. 5 shows the results for the fourth

the lower frequency range is indeed better than the one
with the higher frequency range (table 4). 5(b) there are more false identified elements (darker

of the excitation in the center (721th dof) and the infe-
rior right corner (1441th dof) of the plate, for the third
damage case, using the frequency range [0, 1900] hz. 6 one sees that the best results are in fact obtained
by applying the excitation at the corner of the plate. in-
deed, many modes have nodes, where the response
amplitude is zero, in the center of the plate and the sys-
tem of equations is more ill-conditioned when one

applies the excitation at this point. hence, one must not
assume a priori that the best results are obtained by
applying the excitation in the damaged area. in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results
presented were obtained using the frequency range
[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations. without errors, equations weighting or deletion
to study the differences among the dynamic and sta-
tic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of
m-dof in the results, tests were performed with the
four incomplete models. after the multiplications in
eq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-
carded, i. , they are not included in the damage identi-
fication process. for example, the incomplete model
with 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations. table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values
for the third damage case. it can be seen that the best
results are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-
pected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-
racy indicators values decrease and the differences
among the methods also become smaller. for the case
of 481 m-dof the differences between the results are
not noticeable. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,
i. , as the sum of the true damage parameters

in-
creases, the error in the identification process, defined by
the absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-
ference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-
sion process and the real damaged structure stiffness
matrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for
large damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-
sion will be very different from the real one. with errors and without equations weighting or
deletion
the presence of measurement noises and errors was
simulated by incorporating a random perturbation of
5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-
aged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-
ing a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform
distribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-
tions relative to u-dof are discarded. the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third
damage case are presented in table 7 and show that
the presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-
fications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy
indicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481
m-dof are equal and with 325 and 156 m-dof are al-
most the same for dynamic and static expansions. table 6

fig. 8 shows a graphic that relates the degree of dam-
age to the absolute value of re when incompleteness
and errors are both present. this graphic presents two
distinct zones, for each case of incompleteness: (1) the
continuous lines relate to the influence of errors alone. in fact, when the damage is small, the differences among
the damage and undamaged structure behaviour will
also be small and, therefore, the errors will overshadow
this differences; (2) the broken lines indicate the influ-
ence of incompleteness, because the expansion of
m-dof is not sufficiently correct for large damage
values (see section 3.2.1). the first damage case presents
almost the same value of re for both 481 and 49
m-dof. this seems to prove that the main influence
is in fact the presence of errors. with errors and equations weighting and deletion
in this sub-section is presented the study of the equa-
tions deletion parameter d, defined by eq. 9(a)
presents the accuracy indicators jrej and mse in func-
tion of d for the third damage case, dynamic expansion

tors are the lowest, with jrej < 0.1400 and mse <
0.0260. the minimum values of jrej and mse are ob-
tained with d = 0.50. however, not all the values of

value of d is 0.50. 10 shows the identification results

by weighting and deleting equations. frf sensitivity technique versus modal sensitivity
technique
comparing the results presented in this paper with
those in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-
ity technique results are better than those based on the
modal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this
last technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-
tions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an
overdetermined set of equations. conclusions
in this paper a damage identification technique based
on frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-
tions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables
least-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution
to be physically admissible. the damage identification
was performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-
tised using a finite element model. it was found that the
frf matrices should be computed with at least three
times the number of natural frequencies and mode
shapes contained in the frequency range of interest. the frequency range and the excitation location are also
important, and the better identification results are ob-
tained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points
were there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-
namic expansion of m-dof presents better results than
those of the static expansion and as the number of
m-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-
sults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors
are the main influence in the identification quality,
whereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes
the most important factor. a procedure for weighting
and deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-
fication results. it was also found that the present tech-
nique presents better results than those obtained when
using a technique based on modal data sensitivities. acknowledgment

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:
xk+

3( rk

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated
randomly from

rdk
is a vector generated

for the dhpsaco algorithm,

is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been
studied by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the material density is

(2767.

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are
±
40 kpsi
(±
275.80 mpa). all nodes
in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±
8.89 mm) imposed on every node in every
direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.

institute of steel construction (aisc) code [13], listed in table 1.

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0

and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

for the 72-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 5, the
material density is

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

abstract
in this paper, a particle swarm optimizer with passive congregation (psopc), ant colony optimization
(aco) and harmony search scheme (hs) are combined to reach to an efficient algorithm, called discrete
heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (dhpsaco). this method is then employed to optimize
truss structures with discrete variables. the dhpsaco applies a psopc for global optimization and the ant
colony approach for local search, similar to its continuous version. the problem-specific constraints are
handled using a modified feasible-based mechanism, and the harmony search scheme is employed to deal
with variable constraints. some design examples are tested using the new method and their results are
compared to those of pso, psopc and hpso algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present
method.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:
xk+

3( rk

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0

and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected

±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±

the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22.

, while it is
22.

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:
xk+

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

pitch adjusting process is performed only after a value is chosen
from
pk
i
. the value (1-par) sets the rate of doing nothing. a par
(pitch adjusting rate) of 0.1 indicates that the algorithm will choose
a neighboring value with 10%

hmcr probability.
if
a∗
controls the exactitude of the solutions with a reverse
relation, the terminating criterion is defined as continuing the
search process until the absolute value of the particles’ velocity is
less than

formula, the agents will be permitted to select discrete values.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may reduce the
exploration in the algorithm. therefore, in order to increase the
exploration, in this paper the velocity of particles is redefined as

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,
a∗
is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.
4.1. a 25-bar spatial truss
the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been
studied by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the material density is

(2767.

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are

40 kpsi
(±
275.80 mpa). all nodes
in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±
8.89 mm) imposed on every node in every
direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0

and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1

to the current position
xk

as follows:

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better

by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,

is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

(±

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0
kg/
m3
and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

for the 72-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 5, the
material density is

(2767.

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v

among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

although this change is simple and efficient, it may reduce the

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,
a∗
is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

(2767.

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are

(±

in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±

direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.

institute of steel construction (aisc) code [13], listed in table 1.

respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated
randomly from

although this change is simple and efficient, it may reduce the

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,
a∗
is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.
4.1. a 25-bar spatial truss
the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been
studied by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the material density is

lb/ in.

(2767.
990

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are
±
40 kpsi
(±
275.80 mpa). all nodes
in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±
8.89 mm) imposed on every node in every
direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a
21
and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.
case 1: the discrete variables are selected from the set d

0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 3.6, 4.0, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2, 5.6, 6.0}

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from the american
institute of steel construction (aisc) code [13], listed in table 1.
the loads for both cases are shown in table 2.

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.

and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected

±

(±

subjected to the displacement limits of

(±

the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22.

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1]. recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries. an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

iran. if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4]. in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section. although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term. there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6]. the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

fig. comparison of the convergence rates of the pso-based algorithms for the 25-bar truss structure. to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism. several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search. the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration. the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk

as follows:

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm. the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2]. then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space. particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

fig. rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution. rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions. comparison of the convergence rates of the pso-based algorithms for the
52-bar truss structure. rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred. rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred. by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability. if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss. in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco. in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the

(in. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower. a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

direction. (c) displacement in the z-direction. pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22. the design history graph is shown in fig. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14]. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method. dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper. four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm. talatahari / journal of constructional steel research 65 (2009) 1558–1568
