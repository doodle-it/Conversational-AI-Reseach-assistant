      "In order to reach a discrete version of HPSACO (i.e. DHPSACO),\n",

      "A combinational discrete optimization approach, called DHP-\n",
      "SACO, is developed for optimal design of trusses. DHPSACO utilizes\n",
      "ACO as an auxiliary tool to improve the PSOPC algorithm which\n",
      "works as a global search. ACO does extra exploitation around the\n",
      "local optimums obtained by particles. A harmony search-based\n",
      "approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. By increas-\n",
      "ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-\n",
      "creases the power of the collective information of the search space\n",
      "and guides the exploration process. In order to make the particles\n",
      "remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based\n",
      "mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-\n",
      "straints. Here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,\n",
      "after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process\n",
      "stops. In the DHPSACO method, agents are allowed to select dis-\n",
      "crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. A new for-\n",
      "mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the\n",
      "performance of the presented method.\n",
      "DHPSACO by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-\n",
      "ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves\n",
      "the performance of the algorithm. DHPSACO does extra searches\n",
      "(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains\n",
      "the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-\n",
      "ber of iterations. In the heuristic methods, the increase in the\n",
      "number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random\n",
      "search factor and increases the power of the collective information\n",
      "factor. In DHPSACO, the ACO and HS stages play an auxiliary role\n",
      "in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding\n",
      "the exploration. Using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-\n",
      "nate additional unnecessary iterations. This goal is fulfilled using a\n",
      "new terminating criterion in this paper.\n",
      "Four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of\n",
      "the DHPSACO algorithm. The comparisons of the numerical results\n",
      "of these trusses using the DHPSACO method with those obtained\n",
      "by other PSO-based approaches are performed to demonstrate\n",

      "to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and\n",
