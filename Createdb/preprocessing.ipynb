      "time. Despite these facts, designers and owners have always\n",
      "desired to have optimal structures [1].\n",
      "Recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous\n",
      "optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant\n",
      "colony optimization (HPSACO) [2], for truss problems, which\n",
      "is low time consuming and highly reliable. In HPSACO, the\n",
      "PSOPC algorithm (a hybrid PSO with passive congregation [3])\n",
      "is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search\n",

      "search (HS) works as a handling approach to deal with variable\n",

      "if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,\n",
      "the problem is considered discrete. HPSACO, similar to PSO and\n",
      "the PSOPC, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural\n",
      "optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which\n",
      "have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better\n",
      "than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].\n",
      "In order to reach a discrete version of HPSACO (i.e. DHPSACO),\n",
      "some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. In\n",
      "the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values\n",
      "from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents\n",
      "selects another value for a design variable, the DHPSACO changes\n",
      "its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.\n",
      "Although this change is simple and efficient, it may however\n",

      "use of penalty functions. When using a penalty function, the\n",
      "amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an\n",
      "infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the\n",
      "selection process. Despite the popularity of penalty functions,\n",
      "there are several drawbacks associated with this method. The main\n",
      "drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty\n",

      "A combinational discrete optimization approach, called DHP-\n",
      "SACO, is developed for optimal design of trusses. DHPSACO utilizes\n",

      "works as a global search. ACO does extra exploitation around the\n",

      "ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-\n",
      "creases the power of the collective information of the search space\n",
      "and guides the exploration process. In order to make the particles\n",
      "remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based\n",
      "mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-\n",
      "straints. Here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,\n",
      "after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process\n",
      "stops. In the DHPSACO method, agents are allowed to select dis-\n",

      "the performance of the algorithm. DHPSACO does extra searches\n",
