text='the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as\\r\\nan increasingly important component of overall nondestructive\\r\\nevaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for\\r\\nimplementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft\\r\\ncomponents, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,\\r\\nthere have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in\\r\\nactual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air\\r\\nforce, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the\\r\\nfederal aviation administration, nasa and the department of\\r\\ntransportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-\\r\\nmon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-\\r\\ntial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples\\r\\ninclude the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-\\r\\nite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical\\r\\nplants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers. successful field implementation of shm has not been widely\\r\\nachieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-\\r\\ning the development and demonstration of shm sensors that\\r\\nhave long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-\\r\\nty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of\\r\\nflaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into\\r\\nstructural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing\\r\\nnumber of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-\\r\\ntion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy\\r\\nand air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these\\r\\nissues. [1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-\\r\\ntion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-\\r\\ntion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;\\r\\nsignificantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new\\r\\nas well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures. defining structural health monitoring\\r\\nshm has been defined differently by various research groups. for\\r\\ninstance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect\\r\\nand interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve\\r\\nreliability and reduce life cycle costs. [2, 3] the greatest challenge\\r\\nin designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look\\r\\nfor and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a\\r\\nparticular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of\\r\\nthe shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,\\r\\nwill dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn\\r\\ndetermines the requirements for the rest of the components in the\\r\\nsystem. much current research focuses on the relationship\\r\\nbetween various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a\\r\\nstructure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-\\r\\nuous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-\\r\\ntion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors\\r\\nwith minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural\\r\\nintegrity of the structure. ”[4] shm includes all monitoring\\r\\naspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc. , which have a\\r\\ndirect influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result\\r\\nfrom fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-\\r\\nditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-\\r\\ntems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and\\r\\nadequate computational models of the structure. for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for\\r\\nfuture aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-\\r\\nnance concepts but will have a significant influence on design\\r\\nconcepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one\\r\\nof the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of\\r\\nfuture aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving\\r\\nbenefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-\\r\\ntion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-\\r\\nponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-\\r\\nation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,\\r\\nwhich would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry. emerging shm technologies\\r\\nthe foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to\\r\\nmonitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive\\r\\nevaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the\\r\\nstructure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant\\r\\nadvances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have\\r\\ndeveloped the hardware and software needed for analysis and\\r\\ncommunication of the shm results. the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree\\r\\nof maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of\\r\\nstructures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive\\r\\nacoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been\\r\\nshown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-\\r\\ntrically conducting materials. fiber optic sensors\\r\\na 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-\\r\\ning (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation\\r\\nof the complex physical principals underlying these sensors. [5]\\r\\nfiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit\\r\\nlight through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a\\r\\nstructure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the\\r\\nlaser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-\\r\\ntion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in\\r\\nh. matzkanin\\r\\nammtiac\\r\\nrome, ny\\r\\n ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 4\\r\\nturn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-\\r\\nal years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d\\r\\nand commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg\\r\\nsensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-\\r\\nposite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the\\r\\ncomposite during its manufacture. japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-\\r\\ning fiber optic sensors systems for shm. [6-9] perhaps the most\\r\\ninteresting work involved the study of the application of both\\r\\nsurface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to\\r\\nfull-scale monitoring of large composite structures. [9] the\\r\\nauthors monitored strain or temperature during composite\\r\\nmanufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance. the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied\\r\\nwere international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a\\r\\njapanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both\\r\\ncases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-\\r\\nature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and\\r\\ntemperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their\\r\\nwork demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed\\r\\nsensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage\\r\\nof the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and\\r\\nstrain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent\\r\\nstructural testing. passive acoustic emission sensors\\r\\nacoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the\\r\\nultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo\\r\\ncracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-\\r\\ntion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure\\r\\ncan be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a\\r\\nstructure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,\\r\\neither attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be\\r\\nused to detect acoustic emission signals. as an example of the broad research and development of\\r\\nacoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously\\r\\nactive fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in\\r\\ncomposite materials. [10] active fiber composite (afc) materials\\r\\nwere a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s\\r\\nand further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)\\r\\nfor use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured\\r\\nand fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain\\r\\nlevels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a\\r\\ntremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-\\r\\nnels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases\\r\\nthe chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic\\r\\nemission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic\\r\\nemission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient\\r\\ndistribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of\\r\\nafc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was\\r\\nmodeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these\\r\\nsensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by\\r\\nthe researchers. the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect\\r\\nactual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to\\r\\nfailure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-\\r\\nventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-\\r\\nducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and\\r\\ngreatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency. active ultrasonic sensors\\r\\nresearch on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a\\r\\ngreat deal of attention over the last several years with researchers\\r\\nfrom several countries, including the united states, the united\\r\\nkingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the\\r\\nliterature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use\\r\\nof ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-\\r\\nical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors. as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic\\r\\npatch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was\\r\\nstudied. [11] the researchers studied the optimization materials\\r\\nand configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-\\r\\nretical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate\\r\\nthe capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-\\r\\ned that they were able to greatly improve the performance of\\r\\nthis class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-\\r\\nopment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced\\r\\nsensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a\\r\\nvery good technique for shm of composites, and they will be\\r\\nused in future field applications. as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the\\r\\nchanges in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers\\r\\nfigure 2. continuous sensors arrangement (2x2 array)\\r\\nchannel 1\\r\\nchannel 2\\r\\ndata acquisition\\r\\nsystem\\r\\ndata acquisition\\r\\nsystem\\r\\ndata acquisition system data acquisition system\\r\\n the ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 5\\r\\nas a function of damage in structures. [12] physical changes in\\r\\nthe structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of\\r\\nthe structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-\\r\\nmechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either\\r\\nbonded to the surface or\\r\\nembedded in the structure. figure 3 shows the interac-\\r\\ntion between a piezoelectric\\r\\ntransducer and its host struc-\\r\\nture as described in a simple\\r\\none-dimensional model. the research concluded\\r\\nthat the effectiveness of sen-\\r\\nsors for shm using changes\\r\\nin the electrical impedance of\\r\\npiezoelectric transducers was\\r\\nsuccessfully demonstrated. selected shm examples\\r\\nin this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a\\r\\nvariety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and\\r\\naerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad\\r\\nsystems. several interesting examples of shm applications have been\\r\\nreported recently. [13] these applications are based on significant\\r\\nadvances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor\\r\\ntechnology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic\\r\\nstrain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with\\r\\noptical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an\\r\\nincreasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of\\r\\nthe equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple\\r\\nfbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing\\r\\n(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique\\r\\noptoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide\\r\\noperating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their\\r\\nfull range, on a single fiber. in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-\\r\\ncal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-\\r\\nward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil\\r\\ntransport aircraft. [13] using the tdm interrogation system, the\\r\\nfbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-\\r\\ning the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike\\r\\ntests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike\\r\\ndemonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage\\r\\nelectrical pulses. another shm example involves application to offshore oil\\r\\ndrilling operations. [13] in deep water operations, tidal currents\\r\\ncan cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring\\r\\nthe oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations\\r\\ninduce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue\\r\\nfailure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a\\r\\n6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to\\r\\nhelp predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve\\r\\nthis result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half\\r\\nsection tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a\\r\\nway as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical\\r\\nfiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both\\r\\nedges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system\\r\\nwas able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser\\r\\npipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted\\r\\nto the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using\\r\\nan electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully\\r\\ndeployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of\\r\\nmexico, and it has been in\\r\\noperation for many months. the use of ultrasonic trans-\\r\\nducers to monitor railroad\\r\\nwheels for cracks has also\\r\\nbeen investigated. [14] the\\r\\nultrasonic signal is intro-\\r\\nduced by the high speed con-\\r\\ntact of the steel railroad\\r\\nwheel to the steel track, and\\r\\nthe signal is detected by a\\r\\npzt transducer placed\\r\\ninside the hollow shaft of the\\r\\nwheel axle. the transducer is\\r\\nconfigured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the\\r\\nrapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a\\r\\nwireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-\\r\\nputer. after development, the shm system was checked on a\\r\\nrailroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable\\r\\nof operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects\\r\\ncracks in the wheels. to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle\\r\\nthermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-\\r\\ning impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the\\r\\nshuttle’s wing leading edge was developed. [15] in addition, a\\r\\nlarge effort was described that focused on understanding the\\r\\ndamage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading\\r\\nedge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to\\r\\nassess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were\\r\\ninstalled between flights. the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the\\r\\nrcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high\\r\\nresolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,\\r\\nacoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array\\r\\nscanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-\\r\\nbility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the\\r\\nshuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space\\r\\ncenter (ksc). the development of a first generation impact sensing system\\r\\nfor the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this\\r\\nsystem is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and\\r\\nablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of\\r\\ndetecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital\\r\\ndebris impacts during flight. the shm system was based\\r\\non wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been\\r\\nqualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this\\r\\naccelerometer based shm system is now used on all space\\r\\nshuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the\\r\\nshuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]\\r\\nconclusions and prognosis\\r\\nover the past decade there has been an impressive research and\\r\\ndevelopment contribution to the knowledge base required for\\r\\nstructural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern\\r\\nparadigm of nondestructive evaluation. c\\r\\npzt\\r\\ncoupled electro-mechanical\\r\\nadmittance y=re(y) + j ιm(y)\\r\\nι = i sin(ωt+φ)\\r\\nv = v sin(ωt) m\\r\\nk\\r\\n ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 6\\r\\nparadigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life\\r\\ncycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,\\r\\nnde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-\\r\\nfacturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-\\r\\nservice inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly\\r\\nmore expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the\\r\\nname of structural health monitoring to include also functional\\r\\nhealth monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components\\r\\nand systems have more than just a mechanical structural\\r\\nrequirement. the shm research and development base has now reached a\\r\\nmodest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,\\r\\nactive ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active\\r\\nmechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,\\r\\nand wireless communications between sensors and a central\\r\\nstation. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern\\r\\nnde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-\\r\\ndigm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:\\r\\n• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors\\r\\nembedded or attached to structures, including environmental\\r\\neffects (e. , temperature) on the sensors;\\r\\n• development of quantitative information in the form of\\r\\npod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems\\r\\nin a variety of applications, including the need for viable\\r\\ncalibration standards and techniques;\\r\\n• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-\\r\\ntures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period\\r\\nof time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems\\r\\nwith integration of results into structural/platform mainte-\\r\\nnance strategies;\\r\\n• development and promulgation of standards covering the\\r\\nstandard practices needed for the widespread application of\\r\\nshm. to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do\\r\\nnot have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps\\r\\nin parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving\\r\\nshm r&d into useful application will require a commitment\\r\\non the part of both shm technology developers and potential\\r\\nusers of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-\\r\\ncation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs\\r\\nassociated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the\\r\\ncost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use\\r\\nis often the case rather than a rarity.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='27169f55-7f37-467f-8cd6-bc21c3b22b2f', embedding=None, metadata={'Title': 'StructuraldamageidentiﬁcationinlaminatedstructuresusingFRFdata', 'urls': \"['www.elsevier.com/locate/compstruct\\\\nto']\", 'refs': '\\r\\n[1] doebling sw, farrar cr, prime mb, shevitz dw. damage\\r\\nidentification and health monitoring of structural and mechanical\\r\\nsystems from changes in their vibration characteristics: a literature\\r\\nreview. la-13070-ms. los alamos national laboratory;

[14]\\r\\nused this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-\\r\\ntural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay\\r\\nframe structure. the results presented show false nega-\\r\\ntive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),\\r\\nsince the unknown variables are not constrained. in case\\r\\nof damage, there would be elements with only a decrease\\r\\nin stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is\\r\\nsolved by constraining the variables to be physically\\r\\nadmissible, i. , the solution is such that there are no\\r\\nfalse negative elements. a problem often encountered in this methods is the\\r\\nmodel incompleteness of the damaged structure, because\\r\\nthe vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-\\r\\nimentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of\\r\\nfreedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the\\r\\ntotal number of undamaged structure degrees of free-\\r\\ndom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-\\r\\nber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom\\r\\n(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises\\r\\nand other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always\\r\\ncontaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,\\r\\nthe problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two\\r\\nmethods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of\\r\\nm-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]\\r\\nand static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by\\r\\nimposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of\\r\\nthe m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of\\r\\nerrors was also taken into account. a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which\\r\\nis discretised using a first-order shear-deformation\\r\\ntheory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-\\r\\nform the numerical tests. it is shown that the number\\r\\nof natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the\\r\\nfrf computation, the frequency range and the exci-\\r\\ntation location are important factors in the accu-\\r\\nracy of the identification results. the results of the\\r\\ntechnique presented in this paper are compared to\\r\\nthose obtained by a technique based on modal data\\r\\n[12]. damage identification technique\\r\\n2.1. frf computation\\r\\nthe frf matrix a(x) of the undamaged structure\\r\\ncan be defined in terms of the modal model, i. , in terms\\r\\nof a specified number of its natural frequencies and\\r\\nmode shapes, as\\r\\naðxþ ¼\\r\\nqðdxþ(cid:4)1 qt\\r\\n;

(17) is not always\\r\\nobtained using algorithms such as the singular value\\r\\ndecompositon (svd) [21,19], as can be seen in [6,7]. [8] two alternative algorithms were pro-\\r\\nposed: the non-negative least-squares (nnls) [21] and\\r\\nthe bounded-variable least-squares (bvls) [22]. the\\r\\nauthors have been using this last

obtained by\\r\\napplying the excitation in the damaged area. in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results\\r\\npresented were obtained using the frequency range\\r\\n[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations. without errors, equations weighting or deletion\\r\\nto study the differences among the dynamic and sta-\\r\\ntic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of\\r\\nm-dof in the results, tests were performed with the\\r\\nfour incomplete models. after the multiplications in\\r\\neq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-\\r\\ncarded, i. , they are not included in the damage identi-\\r\\nfication process. for example, the incomplete model\\r\\nwith 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations. table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values\\r\\nfor the third damage case. it can be seen that the best\\r\\nresults are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-\\r\\npected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-\\r\\nracy indicators values decrease and the differences\\r\\namong the methods also become smaller. for the case\\r\\nof 481 m-dof the differences between the results are\\r\\nnot noticeable. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,\\r\\ni. , as the sum of the true damage parameters\\r\\nkdbt\\r\\nk\\r\\n1\\r\\nin-\\r\\ncreases, the error in the identification process, defined by\\r\\nthe absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-\\r\\nference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-\\r\\nsion process and the real damaged structure stiffness\\r\\nmatrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for\\r\\nlarge damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-\\r\\nsion will be very different from the real one. with errors and without equations weighting or\\r\\ndeletion\\r\\nthe presence of measurement noises and errors was\\r\\nsimulated by incorporating a random perturbation of\\r\\n5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-\\r\\naged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-\\r\\ning a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform\\r\\ndistribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-\\r\\ntions relative to u-dof are discarded. the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third\\r\\ndamage case are presented in table 7 and show that\\r\\nthe presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-\\r\\nfications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy\\r\\nindicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481\\r\\nm-dof are equal and with 325

paper with\\r\\nthose in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-\\r\\nity technique results are better than those based on the\\r\\nmodal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this\\r\\nlast technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-\\r\\ntions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an\\r\\noverdetermined set of equations. conclusions\\r\\nin this paper a damage identification technique based\\r\\non frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-\\r\\ntions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables\\r\\nleast-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution\\r\\nto be physically admissible. the damage identification\\r\\nwas performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-\\r\\ntised using a finite element model. it was found that the\\r\\nfrf matrices should be computed with at least three\\r\\ntimes the number of natural frequencies and mode\\r\\nshapes contained in the frequency range of interest. the frequency range and the excitation location are also\\r\\nimportant, and the better identification results are ob-\\r\\ntained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points\\r\\nwere there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-\\r\\nnamic expansion of m-dof presents better results than\\r\\nthose of the static expansion and as the number of\\r\\nm-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-\\r\\nsults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors\\r\\nare the main influence in the identification quality,\\r\\nwhereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes\\r\\nthe most important factor. a procedure for weighting\\r\\nand deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-\\r\\nfication results. it was also found that the present tech-\\r\\nnique presents better results than those obtained when\\r\\nusing a technique based on modal data sensitivities. acknowledgment\\r\\nthe authors would like to thank the financial support\\r\\nreceived from fct and

the search space and\\r\\nthe control of a great number of design constraints are major\\r\\npreventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable\\r\\ntime. despite these facts, designers and owners have always\\r\\ndesired to have optimal structures [1]. recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous\\r\\noptimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant\\r\\ncolony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which\\r\\nis low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the\\r\\npsopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])\\r\\nis combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search\\r\\napproach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization\\r\\nand an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,\\r\\nwherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update\\r\\nthe positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony\\r\\nsearch (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable\\r\\nboundaries. an optimization problem can be considered either as a\\r\\ncontinuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the\\r\\ndesign variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while\\r\\n∗\\r\\ncorresponding author. : +43 1 58801 60231; fax: +43 1 58801 20299. 1\\r\\non leave from iran university of science and technology, narmak, tehran-16,\\r\\niran. if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,\\r\\nthe problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and\\r\\nthe psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural\\r\\noptimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which\\r\\nhave discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better\\r\\nthan a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4]. in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i. dhpsaco),\\r\\nsome changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in\\r\\nthe discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values\\r\\nfrom the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents\\r\\nselects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes\\r\\nits magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section. although this change is simple and efficient, it may however\\r\\nreduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for\\r\\nthe particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration\\r\\nterm. there are some constraints in truss optimization problems\\r\\nthat should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have\\r\\nbeen proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to\\r\\nsolve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common\\r\\napproach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the\\r\\nuse of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the\\r\\namount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an\\r\\ninfeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the\\r\\nselection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,\\r\\nthere are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main\\r\\ndrawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty\\r\\nfactors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to\\r\\nbe applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6]. the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach\\r\\n0143-974x/$ – see front matter\\r\\n©\\r\\n2009 elsevier ltd. talatahari / journal of constructional steel research 65 (2009) 1558–1568 1559\\r\\nfig. comparison of

the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic\\r\\nalgorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as\\r\\nfollows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section

optimization for truss\\r\\nstructures\\r\\n3.1. review of continuous hpsaco\\r\\nthe heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)\\r\\nalgorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco\\r\\nworks as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided\\r\\nmechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc\\r\\nstage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of\\r\\naco is proposed and employed for the local search. the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are\\r\\ninitialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly\\r\\nthrough the search space and their positions are updated based on\\r\\nthe best positions of individual particles, the best position among\\r\\nall particles in the search space, and the position of a particle\\r\\nselected randomly from the swarm in each iteration. the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v\\r\\nk+ 1\\r\\ni\\r\\n,\\r\\nto the current position\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\nas follows:\\r\\nxk+\\r\\n1\\r\\ni\\r\\n= xk\\r\\ni\\r\\n+\\r\\nv\\r\\nk+\\r\\n1\\r\\ni\\r\\n(2)\\r\\nv\\r\\nk+ 1\\r\\ni\\r\\n= ω\\r\\nv\\r\\nk\\r\\ni\\r\\n+\\r\\nc

k;\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\nis the best position\\r\\namong all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r\\r\\ni\\r\\nis a\\r\\nparticle selected randomly from the swarm. the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in\\r\\nthe psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\nwhich\\r\\ncan be expressed as\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n= n( pk\\r\\ng\\r\\n, σ )\\r\\n(4)\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\nis the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;\\r\\nn(\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\n, σ )\\r\\ndenotes a random number normally distributed with mean value\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\nand variance\\r\\nσ\\r\\n, where\\r\\nσ = (\\r\\na\\r\\nmax\\r\\n−\\r\\na\\r\\nmin) × η\\r\\n(5)\\r\\nη\\r\\nis the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as\\r\\na helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control\\r\\nin the exploitation [2]. then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f\\r\\n(\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\n, is\\r\\ncomputed and the current position of ant i,\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n, is replaced with the\\r\\nposition\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\n, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f\\r\\n(\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\nis bigger than f\\r\\n(\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\nand current ant is in the feasible space. particles in the search space may violate either the problem-\\r\\nspecific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a\\r\\nmodified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-\\r\\nspecific constraints which

text='the subject of structural health monitoring (shm) is emerging as\\r\\nan increasingly important component of overall nondestructive\\r\\nevaluation (nde) programs and is now being considered for\\r\\nimplementation in a variety of applications including spacecraft\\r\\ncomponents, bridges, and aircraft. over the past several years,\\r\\nthere have been a number of limited demonstrations of shm in\\r\\nactual field applications. in addition to the army, navy and air\\r\\nforce, other federal agencies interested in this topic include the\\r\\nfederal aviation administration, nasa and the department of\\r\\ntransportation. the detection of damage at any location is a com-\\r\\nmon challenge in most large structures, and thus shm has poten-\\r\\ntial applications across a range of industrial sectors. examples\\r\\ninclude the detection of impact induced delaminations in compos-\\r\\nite aerospace structures, localized corrosion in petrochemical\\r\\nplants and unauthorized penetrations of shipping containers. successful field implementation of shm has not been widely\\r\\nachieved and depends on overcoming several roadblocks includ-\\r\\ning the development and demonstration of shm sensors that\\r\\nhave long term stability and reliability, validation of the capabili-\\r\\nty of the shm systems in terms of the probability of detection of\\r\\nflaws, and finally the integration of the shm system results into\\r\\nstructural and platform maintenance strategies. an increasing\\r\\nnumber of efforts are focusing on identifying these implementa-\\r\\ntion issues and developing solutions for them. the army, navy\\r\\nand air force recently sponsored a workshop to address these\\r\\nissues. [1] the benefits that will flow from successful implementa-\\r\\ntion of shm will include: replacing schedule-based inspec-\\r\\ntion/maintenance of a structure by condition-based maintenance;\\r\\nsignificantly reducing life-cycle cost, and improving safety of new\\r\\nas well as aging aircraft, aerospace, and civil structures. defining structural health monitoring\\r\\nshm has been defined differently by various research groups. for\\r\\ninstance, it has been defined as a system with the ability to detect\\r\\nand interpret adverse “changes” in a structure in order to improve\\r\\nreliability and reduce life cycle costs. [2, 3] the greatest challenge\\r\\nin designing a shm system is knowing what “changes” to look\\r\\nfor and how to identify them. the characteristics of damage in a\\r\\nparticular structure play a key role in defining the architecture of\\r\\nthe shm system. the resulting “changes,” or damage signature,\\r\\nwill dictate the type of sensors that are required, which in turn\\r\\ndetermines the requirements for the rest of the components in the\\r\\nsystem. much current research focuses on the relationship\\r\\nbetween various sensors and their ability to detect “change” in a\\r\\nstructure’s behavior. another author defines shm as the “contin-\\r\\nuous, autonomous in-service monitoring of the physical condi-\\r\\ntion of a structure by means of embedded or attached sensors\\r\\nwith minimum manual intervention, to monitor the structural\\r\\nintegrity of the structure. ”[4] shm includes all monitoring\\r\\naspects related to damages, loads, conditions, etc. , which have a\\r\\ndirect influence on the structure. the sources of faults can result\\r\\nfrom fatigue, corrosion, impacts, excessive loads, unforeseen con-\\r\\nditions, etc. regardless of the definition, however, all shm sys-\\r\\ntems require a combination of data acquisition by sensors and\\r\\nadequate computational models of the structure. for aircraft applications, the uses of shm technologies for\\r\\nfuture aircraft will not only enable new possibilities for mainte-\\r\\nnance concepts but will have a significant influence on design\\r\\nconcepts and assembling technologies. shm is expected to be one\\r\\nof the key technologies for controlling the structural integrity of\\r\\nfuture aircraft, providing both maintenance and weight saving\\r\\nbenefits. some of the advantages over conventional nde inspec-\\r\\ntion include reduced inspection down time, elimination of com-\\r\\nponent tear down, and potential prevention of failure during oper-\\r\\nation. shm is likely to be used in identifying failures in aircraft,\\r\\nwhich would also be a boon to the commercial aircraft industry. emerging shm technologies\\r\\nthe foundation of structural health monitoring is the ability to\\r\\nmonitor structures using embedded or attached nondestructive\\r\\nevaluation sensors and to utilize the data to assess the state of the\\r\\nstructure. over the last ten years researchers have made significant\\r\\nadvances in developing nde sensors for shm, and they have\\r\\ndeveloped the hardware and software needed for analysis and\\r\\ncommunication of the shm results. the nde shm sensors that have reached some modest degree\\r\\nof maturing and are able to monitor significantly large areas of\\r\\nstructures include fiber optics, active ultrasonics, and passive\\r\\nacoustic emission. eddy current type sensor arrays have also been\\r\\nshown to be potentially useful in monitoring local areas in elec-\\r\\ntrically conducting materials. fiber optic sensors\\r\\na 2001 study reviewed the early development of fiber bragg grat-\\r\\ning (fbg) based nde sensors and also provided an explanation\\r\\nof the complex physical principals underlying these sensors. [5]\\r\\nfiber optic sensors generally utilize a laser light source to transmit\\r\\nlight through the fiber, which is either bonded to the surface of a\\r\\nstructure or embedded in a structure. the perturbations to the\\r\\nlaser light involving phase, amplitude, and frequency are a func-\\r\\ntion of the temperature and stress of the fiber optic, which are in\\r\\nh. matzkanin\\r\\nammtiac\\r\\nrome, ny\\r\\n ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 4\\r\\nturn a function of the state of the structure. over the past sever-\\r\\nal years, fbg sensors have been the subject of very active r&d\\r\\nand commercial products are now appearing on the market. fbg\\r\\nsensors are particularly suited to fiber reinforced polymer com-\\r\\nposite structures since the small fiber optics can be placed in the\\r\\ncomposite during its manufacture. japanese researchers have been particularly active in develop-\\r\\ning fiber optic sensors systems for shm. [6-9] perhaps the most\\r\\ninteresting work involved the study of the application of both\\r\\nsurface mounted and embedded fiber optic distributed sensors to\\r\\nfull-scale monitoring of large composite structures. [9] the\\r\\nauthors monitored strain or temperature during composite\\r\\nmanufacture and stiffness for in-service structural performance. the carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite structures studied\\r\\nwere international america’s cup class (iacc) yachts and a\\r\\njapanese experimental reentry space vehicle (hope-x). in both\\r\\ncases, fiber optic sensors were used to measure strain and temper-\\r\\nature. the authors concluded that they could measure strain and\\r\\ntemperature in these full-scale composite structures, and their\\r\\nwork demonstrated the great potential of fiber optic distributed\\r\\nsensors for shm of large structures. figure 1 shows the fuselage\\r\\nof the reentry vehicle that was monitored for temperature and\\r\\nstrain during the cure cycle and also for strain in subsequent\\r\\nstructural testing. passive acoustic emission sensors\\r\\nacoustic emission sensors are utilized to detect and monitor the\\r\\nultrasonic waves produced by materials when materials undergo\\r\\ncracking that can lead to structure failure. by means of triangula-\\r\\ntion, an array of acoustic emission sensors attached to a structure\\r\\ncan be used to determine the location of growing cracks in a\\r\\nstructure. in addition, highly sensitive fiber optic bragg sensors,\\r\\neither attached to the surface or embedded in a structure, can be\\r\\nused to detect acoustic emission signals. as an example of the broad research and development of\\r\\nacoustic emission sensors for shm, a new class of continuously\\r\\nactive fiber composite sensors was developed to detect damage in\\r\\ncomposite materials. [10] active fiber composite (afc) materials\\r\\nwere a new class of materials developed at mit in the late 1990s\\r\\nand further developed at nasa as microfiber composites (mfc)\\r\\nfor use in actuator applications. afc materials were reconfigured\\r\\nand fabricated to make low cost sensors that can detect strain\\r\\nlevels as well as acoustic emission signals. this resulted in a\\r\\ntremendous reduction in the number of data acquisition chan-\\r\\nnels needed for shm of large structures, and it greatly increases\\r\\nthe chance of having acoustic emission sensors near an acoustic\\r\\nemission source. since ultrasonic waves generated by acoustic\\r\\nemission events attenuate rapidly, it is essential to have a sufficient\\r\\ndistribution of sensors in composite structures. the response of\\r\\nafc sensors (also known as piezoceramic active fiber sensors) was\\r\\nmodeled, and the researchers described how to manufacture these\\r\\nsensors. figure 2 shows the design of a 2x2 sensor array used by\\r\\nthe researchers. the authors concluded that afc sensors were able to detect\\r\\nactual damage propagation in a composite structure tested to\\r\\nfailure long before the structure failed. when compared to con-\\r\\nventional acoustic emission sensors or piezoelectric patch trans-\\r\\nducers, the afc sensors also showed increased ruggedness and\\r\\ngreatly improved unidirectional sensing and higher efficiency. active ultrasonic sensors\\r\\nresearch on active ultrasonic sensors for shm has received a\\r\\ngreat deal of attention over the last several years with researchers\\r\\nfrom several countries, including the united states, the united\\r\\nkingdom, france, germany, and china, contributing to the\\r\\nliterature. many of the research efforts have focused on the use\\r\\nof ultrasonic lamb waves for shm or the use of electromechan-\\r\\nical impedance methods using piezoelectric wave active sensors. as an example, the optimization of piezoelectric ultrasonic\\r\\npatch sensors for the lamb wave monitoring of composites was\\r\\nstudied. [11] the researchers studied the optimization materials\\r\\nand configurations for this type of sensor and carried out theo-\\r\\nretical and experimental studies to determine and demonstrate\\r\\nthe capability of these sensors. the authors of this research stat-\\r\\ned that they were able to greatly improve the performance of\\r\\nthis class of sensors, and they believed that their further devel-\\r\\nopment of new wavelet analysis techniques have also enhanced\\r\\nsensor capability. it was concluded that lamb waves provide a\\r\\nvery good technique for shm of composites, and they will be\\r\\nused in future field applications. as another example, researchers investigated monitoring the\\r\\nchanges in the electrical impedance of piezoelectric transducers\\r\\nfigure 2. continuous sensors arrangement (2x2 array)\\r\\nchannel 1\\r\\nchannel 2\\r\\ndata acquisition\\r\\nsystem\\r\\ndata acquisition\\r\\nsystem\\r\\ndata acquisition system data acquisition system\\r\\n the ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 5\\r\\nas a function of damage in structures. [12] physical changes in\\r\\nthe structure cause changes in the mechanical impedance of\\r\\nthe structure, and this is detected by changes in the electro-\\r\\nmechnical coupling of the piezoelectric patch transducers either\\r\\nbonded to the surface or\\r\\nembedded in the structure. figure 3 shows the interac-\\r\\ntion between a piezoelectric\\r\\ntransducer and its host struc-\\r\\nture as described in a simple\\r\\none-dimensional model. the research concluded\\r\\nthat the effectiveness of sen-\\r\\nsors for shm using changes\\r\\nin the electrical impedance of\\r\\npiezoelectric transducers was\\r\\nsuccessfully demonstrated. selected shm examples\\r\\nin this section, selected examples of applications of shm to a\\r\\nvariety of structural systems are provided, including aircraft and\\r\\naerospace systems, space vehicles, offshore structures, and railroad\\r\\nsystems. several interesting examples of shm applications have been\\r\\nreported recently. [13] these applications are based on significant\\r\\nadvances which have been made in recent years to evolve sensor\\r\\ntechnology from conventional electrical strain gages to fiber optic\\r\\nstrain sensors. the technology, especially that associated with\\r\\noptical fiber bragg gratings (fbg), has rapidly matured with an\\r\\nincreasing commercial supplier base; the size, weight, and cost of\\r\\nthe equipment has fallen dramatically. for interrogating multiple\\r\\nfbg sensors on a single fiber, a time-division-multiplexing\\r\\n(tdm) interrogator unit has been developed that uses a unique\\r\\noptoelectronic architecture capable of high resolution over a wide\\r\\noperating range; it can interrogate over 100 gages, each to their\\r\\nfull range, on a single fiber. in an aircraft application, a number of fbgs on a single opti-\\r\\ncal fiber were embedded in both the web and flange of the for-\\r\\nward spar of a developmental composite winglet for a large civil\\r\\ntransport aircraft. [13] using the tdm interrogation system, the\\r\\nfbgs were successful in measuring the strain in the spar, includ-\\r\\ning the shock loads induced by both lightning and bird strike\\r\\ntests. the ability to detect strain during the lightning strike\\r\\ndemonstrated the system’s resistance to the effects of high voltage\\r\\nelectrical pulses. another shm example involves application to offshore oil\\r\\ndrilling operations. [13] in deep water operations, tidal currents\\r\\ncan cause vortex induced vibrations in the riser pipes that bring\\r\\nthe oil and gas from the sea bed to the surface. these vibrations\\r\\ninduce strains in the pipe, which can result in premature fatigue\\r\\nfailure. the requirement was to measure the strain induced in a\\r\\n6-inch diameter steel riser pipe and to use the resultant data to\\r\\nhelp predict the residual life remaining in the riser. to achieve\\r\\nthis result, an optical fiber was embedded in a composite half\\r\\nsection tube that could then be strapped to the pipe in such a\\r\\nway as to follow the shape of the pipe as it flexed. the optical\\r\\nfiber was placed so that the fbgs were positioned along both\\r\\nedges and the center line of the half pipe. the resulting system\\r\\nwas able to detect strains down to one microstrain in the riser\\r\\npipe. the tdm interrogator was mounted in a container fitted\\r\\nto the half pipe, with data being transferred to the surface using\\r\\nan electrical umbilical. the system has been successfully\\r\\ndeployed at depths of 6000 feet on an oil platform in the gulf of\\r\\nmexico, and it has been in\\r\\noperation for many months. the use of ultrasonic trans-\\r\\nducers to monitor railroad\\r\\nwheels for cracks has also\\r\\nbeen investigated. [14] the\\r\\nultrasonic signal is intro-\\r\\nduced by the high speed con-\\r\\ntact of the steel railroad\\r\\nwheel to the steel track, and\\r\\nthe signal is detected by a\\r\\npzt transducer placed\\r\\ninside the hollow shaft of the\\r\\nwheel axle. the transducer is\\r\\nconfigured to withstand the centrifugal forces generated by the\\r\\nrapidly turning wheel and shaft. the transducer is coupled to a\\r\\nwireless transmitter system that sends data to an industrial com-\\r\\nputer. after development, the shm system was checked on a\\r\\nrailroad test bed run by a german railroad. the system is capable\\r\\nof operating at high wheel speeds, and it reproducibly detects\\r\\ncracks in the wheels. to meet the concerns of the integrity of nasa’s space shuttle\\r\\nthermal protection system, a certified shm system for monitor-\\r\\ning impacts to the reinforced carbon-carbon (rcc) on the\\r\\nshuttle’s wing leading edge was developed. [15] in addition, a\\r\\nlarge effort was described that focused on understanding the\\r\\ndamage that took place on space shuttle columbia’s leading\\r\\nedge, including a number of nde techniques that were used to\\r\\nassess the integrity of the shuttle’s leading edge while they were\\r\\ninstalled between flights. the conventional nde techniques investigated to inspect the\\r\\nrcc on the ground included: advanced digital radiography, high\\r\\nresolution computed tomography, thermography, ultrasound,\\r\\nacoustic emission, and eddy current systems. eddy current array\\r\\nscanning and thermography demonstrated the maturity and capa-\\r\\nbility to inspect the rcc from one side while installed on the\\r\\nshuttle, and this was successfully field tested at kennedy space\\r\\ncenter (ksc). the development of a first generation impact sensing system\\r\\nfor the shuttle wing rcc leading edge was also reported. this\\r\\nsystem is capable of detecting impacts from foam, ice, and\\r\\nablator materials during ascent velocities. it is also capable of\\r\\ndetecting simulated hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital\\r\\ndebris impacts during flight. the shm system was based\\r\\non wireless accelerometer sensors that had previously been\\r\\nqualified for use on the shuttle for other applications. this\\r\\naccelerometer based shm system is now used on all space\\r\\nshuttle flights to help ensure the continued integrity of the\\r\\nshuttle wing’s leading edge rcc system. [16]\\r\\nconclusions and prognosis\\r\\nover the past decade there has been an impressive research and\\r\\ndevelopment contribution to the knowledge base required for\\r\\nstructural health monitoring to assume its place in the modern\\r\\nparadigm of nondestructive evaluation. c\\r\\npzt\\r\\ncoupled electro-mechanical\\r\\nadmittance y=re(y) + j ιm(y)\\r\\nι = i sin(ωt+φ)\\r\\nv = v sin(ωt) m\\r\\nk\\r\\n ammtiac quarterly, volume 3, number 4 6\\r\\nparadigm views nde as a contributor to the successful, full life\\r\\ncycle of materials, components and systems. in this vision,\\r\\nnde contributes to product and process design, in-line manu-\\r\\nfacturing process control, after manufacturing inspection, in-\\r\\nservice inspection, and structural health monitoring. a slightly\\r\\nmore expansive view of the nde paradigm would broaden the\\r\\nname of structural health monitoring to include also functional\\r\\nhealth monitoring (s&fhm), since many critical components\\r\\nand systems have more than just a mechanical structural\\r\\nrequirement. the shm research and development base has now reached a\\r\\nmodest level of maturity with a foundation in fiber optic sensors,\\r\\nactive ultrasonic sensors for guided lamb waves and active\\r\\nmechanical impedance measurements, acoustic emission sensors,\\r\\nand wireless communications between sensors and a central\\r\\nstation. in order for shm to take its full place in the modern\\r\\nnde paradigm and fully contribute to the modern nde para-\\r\\ndigm, several steps need to be taken. these steps include:\\r\\n• additional study of the long term stability of nde sensors\\r\\nembedded or attached to structures, including environmental\\r\\neffects (e. , temperature) on the sensors;\\r\\n• development of quantitative information in the form of\\r\\npod-type studies on the capability of various shm systems\\r\\nin a variety of applications, including the need for viable\\r\\ncalibration standards and techniques;\\r\\n• broader scale application demonstrations on important struc-\\r\\ntures in a realistic field environment over a reasonable period\\r\\nof time and covering a variety of nde sensors/shm systems\\r\\nwith integration of results into structural/platform mainte-\\r\\nnance strategies;\\r\\n• development and promulgation of standards covering the\\r\\nstandard practices needed for the widespread application of\\r\\nshm. to accelerate the maturation of shm, perhaps these steps do\\r\\nnot have to be made in sequence since taking some of these steps\\r\\nin parallel could lead to a faster, successful conclusion. moving\\r\\nshm r&d into useful application will require a commitment\\r\\non the part of both shm technology developers and potential\\r\\nusers of the technology. the cost to realize full scale, useful appli-\\r\\ncation will most likely be substantial when compared to the costs\\r\\nassociated with the r&d that has already taken place, since the\\r\\ncost “snowballing” as r&d is moved along the path to full use\\r\\nis often the case rather than a rarity.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='27169f55-7f37-467f-8cd6-bc21c3b22b2f', embedding=None, metadata={'Title': 'StructuraldamageidentiﬁcationinlaminatedstructuresusingFRFdata', 'urls': \"['www.elsevier.com/locate/compstruct\\\\nto']\", 'refs': '\\r\\n[1] doebling sw, farrar cr, prime mb, shevitz dw. damage\\r\\nidentification and health monitoring of structural and mechanical\\r\\nsystems from changes in their vibration characteristics: a literature\\r\\nreview. la-13070-ms. los alamos national laboratory;

[14]\\r\\nused this technique to (i) update the undamaged struc-\\r\\ntural model and (ii) identify damage in a plane 3-bay\\r\\nframe structure. the results presented show false nega-\\r\\ntive elements (elements with an increase in stiffness),\\r\\nsince the unknown variables are not constrained. in case\\r\\nof damage, there would be elements with only a decrease\\r\\nin stiffness. in the present work, the set of equations is\\r\\nsolved by constraining the variables to be physically\\r\\nadmissible, i. , the solution is such that there are no\\r\\nfalse negative elements. a problem often encountered in this methods is the\\r\\nmodel incompleteness of the damaged structure, because\\r\\nthe vibrational characteristics should be obtained exper-\\r\\nimentally and, for example, the rotational degrees of\\r\\nfreedom are very difficult to measure. as a result, the\\r\\ntotal number of undamaged structure degrees of free-\\r\\ndom (t-dof), computed analytically, exceeds the num-\\r\\nber of damaged structure measured degrees of freedom\\r\\n(m-dof). furthermore, due to measurement noises\\r\\nand other uncertainties, the frf m-dof are always\\r\\ncontaminated to some extent with errors. in this work,\\r\\nthe problem of model incompleteness is dealt with two\\r\\nmethods: (i) dynamic and (ii) static expansions of\\r\\nm-dof. these methods are based on the dynamic [16]\\r\\nand static [17] reduction methods, respectively. by\\r\\nimposing a random perturbation in the amplitudes of\\r\\nthe m-dof of the damaged structure, the presence of\\r\\nerrors was also taken into account. a laminated rectangular plate free in space, which\\r\\nis discretised using a first-order shear-deformation\\r\\ntheory (fsdt) based element [18], was used to per-\\r\\nform the numerical tests. it is shown that the number\\r\\nof natural frequencies and mode shapes used on the\\r\\nfrf computation, the frequency range and the exci-\\r\\ntation location are important factors in the accu-\\r\\nracy of the identification results. the results of the\\r\\ntechnique presented in this paper are compared to\\r\\nthose obtained by a technique based on modal data\\r\\n[12]. damage identification technique\\r\\n2.1. frf computation\\r\\nthe frf matrix a(x) of the undamaged structure\\r\\ncan be defined in terms of the modal model, i. , in terms\\r\\nof a specified number of its natural frequencies and\\r\\nmode shapes, as\\r\\naðxþ ¼\\r\\nqðdxþ(cid:4)1 qt\\r\\n;

obtained by\\r\\napplying the excitation in the damaged area. in all the remaining sections of this paper, the results\\r\\npresented were obtained using the frequency range\\r\\n[0, 1900] hz, which leads to m = 40404 equations. without errors, equations weighting or deletion\\r\\nto study the differences among the dynamic and sta-\\r\\ntic expansions, as well as the influence of the number of\\r\\nm-dof in the results, tests were performed with the\\r\\nfour incomplete models. after the multiplications in\\r\\neq. (16), the equations relative to the u-dof are dis-\\r\\ncarded, i. , they are not included in the damage identi-\\r\\nfication process. for example, the incomplete model\\r\\nwith 49 m-dof leads to m = 49 · 28 = 1372 equations. table 6 shows the dme, fae, mse and re values\\r\\nfor the third damage case. it can be seen that the best\\r\\nresults are obtained with the dynamic expansion. as ex-\\r\\npected, when the number of m-dof increases the accu-\\r\\nracy indicators values decrease and the differences\\r\\namong the methods also become smaller. for the case\\r\\nof 481 m-dof the differences between the results are\\r\\nnot noticeable. 7 one can see that as the damage increases,\\r\\ni. , as the sum of the true damage parameters\\r\\nkdbt\\r\\nk\\r\\n1\\r\\nin-\\r\\ncreases, the error in the identification process, defined by\\r\\nthe absolute value of re, also increases. in fact, the dif-\\r\\nference between the stiffness matrices used in the expan-\\r\\nsion process and the real damaged structure stiffness\\r\\nmatrices increases as the damage increases. hence, for\\r\\nlarge damage, the vector ~a lðxþ obtained with the expan-\\r\\nsion will be very different from the real one. with errors and without equations weighting or\\r\\ndeletion\\r\\nthe presence of measurement noises and errors was\\r\\nsimulated by incorporating a random perturbation of\\r\\n5.0% error in the amplitudes of the m-dof of the dam-\\r\\naged structure. these errors were simulated by generat-\\r\\ning a random number r 2 [0, 1] in a uniform\\r\\ndistribution. as in the previous sub-section, the equa-\\r\\ntions relative to u-dof are discarded. the dme, fae, mse and re values for the third\\r\\ndamage case are presented in table 7 and show that\\r\\nthe presence of errors leads to incorrect damage identi-\\r\\nfications and have a strong influence on all the accuracy\\r\\nindicators. note that the accuracy indicators with 481\\r\\nm-dof are equal and with 325

paper with\\r\\nthose in [12], it can be concluded that the frf sensitiv-\\r\\nity technique results are better than those based on the\\r\\nmodal sensitivity. one of the causes for this is that this\\r\\nlast technique presents an underdetermined set of equa-\\r\\ntions, whereas the technique presented here leads to an\\r\\noverdetermined set of equations. conclusions\\r\\nin this paper a damage identification technique based\\r\\non frf sensitivities is presented. the set of linear equa-\\r\\ntions obtained is solved using the bounded-variables\\r\\nleast-squares algorithm, which constrains the solution\\r\\nto be physically admissible. the damage identification\\r\\nwas performed on a laminated rectangular plate, discre-\\r\\ntised using a finite element model. it was found that the\\r\\nfrf matrices should be computed with at least three\\r\\ntimes the number of natural frequencies and mode\\r\\nshapes contained in the frequency range of interest. the frequency range and the excitation location are also\\r\\nimportant, and the better identification results are ob-\\r\\ntained in lower frequency ranges and excitation points\\r\\nwere there are no nodes. the tests show that the dy-\\r\\nnamic expansion of m-dof presents better results than\\r\\nthose of the static expansion and as the number of\\r\\nm-dof increases, there are an improvement in the re-\\r\\nsults. it is demonstrated that for small damage the errors\\r\\nare the main influence in the identification quality,\\r\\nwhereas for large damage the incompleteness becomes\\r\\nthe most important factor. a procedure for weighting\\r\\nand deletion of equations is used to improve the identi-\\r\\nfication results. it was also found that the present tech-\\r\\nnique presents better results than those obtained when\\r\\nusing a technique based on modal data sensitivities. acknowledgment\\r\\nthe authors would like to thank the financial support\\r\\nreceived from fct and

the search space and\\r\\nthe control of a great number of design constraints are major\\r\\npreventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable\\r\\ntime. despite these facts, designers and owners have always\\r\\ndesired to have optimal structures [1]. recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous\\r\\noptimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant\\r\\ncolony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which\\r\\nis low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the\\r\\npsopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])\\r\\nis combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search\\r\\napproach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization\\r\\nand an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,\\r\\nwherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update\\r\\nthe positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony\\r\\nsearch (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable\\r\\nboundaries. an optimization problem can be considered either as a\\r\\ncontinuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the\\r\\ndesign variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while\\r\\n∗\\r\\ncorresponding author. : +43 1 58801 60231; fax: +43 1 58801 20299. 1\\r\\non leave from iran university of science and technology, narmak, tehran-16,\\r\\niran. if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,\\r\\nthe problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and\\r\\nthe psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural\\r\\noptimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which\\r\\nhave discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better\\r\\nthan a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4]. in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i. dhpsaco),\\r\\nsome changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in\\r\\nthe discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values\\r\\nfrom the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents\\r\\nselects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes\\r\\nits magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section. although this change is simple and efficient, it may however\\r\\nreduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for\\r\\nthe particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration\\r\\nterm. there are some constraints in truss optimization problems\\r\\nthat should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have\\r\\nbeen proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to\\r\\nsolve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common\\r\\napproach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the\\r\\nuse of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the\\r\\namount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an\\r\\ninfeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the\\r\\nselection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,\\r\\nthere are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main\\r\\ndrawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty\\r\\nfactors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to\\r\\nbe applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6]. the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach\\r\\n0143-974x/$ – see front matter\\r\\n©\\r\\n2009 elsevier ltd. talatahari / journal of constructional steel research 65 (2009) 1558–1568 1559\\r\\nfig. comparison of

the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic\\r\\nalgorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as\\r\\nfollows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section

optimization for truss\\r\\nstructures\\r\\n3.1. review of continuous hpsaco\\r\\nthe heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)\\r\\nalgorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco\\r\\nworks as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided\\r\\nmechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc\\r\\nstage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of\\r\\naco is proposed and employed for the local search. the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are\\r\\ninitialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly\\r\\nthrough the search space and their positions are updated based on\\r\\nthe best positions of individual particles, the best position among\\r\\nall particles in the search space, and the position of a particle\\r\\nselected randomly from the swarm in each iteration. the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v\\r\\nk+ 1\\r\\ni\\r\\n,\\r\\nto the current position\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\nas follows:\\r\\nxk+\\r\\n1\\r\\ni\\r\\n= xk\\r\\ni\\r\\n+\\r\\nv\\r\\nk+\\r\\n1\\r\\ni\\r\\n(2)\\r\\nv\\r\\nk+ 1\\r\\ni\\r\\n= ω\\r\\nv\\r\\nk\\r\\ni\\r\\n+\\r\\nc

k;\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\nis the best position\\r\\namong all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r\\r\\ni\\r\\nis a\\r\\nparticle selected randomly from the swarm. the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in\\r\\nthe psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around\\r\\npk\\r\\ng\\r\\nwhich\\r\\ncan be expressed as\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n= n( pk\\r\\ng\\r\\n, σ

as\\r\\na helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control\\r\\nin the exploitation [2]. then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f\\r\\n(\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\n, is\\r\\ncomputed and the current position of ant i,\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n, is replaced with the\\r\\nposition\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\n, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f\\r\\n(\\r\\nxk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\nis bigger than f\\r\\n(\\r\\nzk\\r\\ni\\r\\n)\\r\\nand current ant is in the feasible space. particles in the search space may violate either the problem-\\r\\nspecific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a\\r\\nmodified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-\\r\\nspecific constraints which

(a) displacement in the x-direction. (b) displacement in the y-\\r\\ndirection. (c) displacement in the z-direction. pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other\\r\\nmeta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated\\r\\nannealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search\\r\\nand genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. evolution\\r\\nstrategies technique gives the second good answer, which is\\r\\nonly 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum\\r\\nweights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony\\r\\noptimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,\\r\\n1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,\\r\\nrespectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso\\r\\nand dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco\\r\\napproach is\\r\\n22. the design history graph is shown in fig. dhpsaco needs nearly\\r\\n8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than\\r\\n50,000 analyses for pso [14]. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and\\r\\ndisplacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of\\r\\ndisplacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. the\\r\\nmaximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure. concluding remarks\\r\\na combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-\\r\\nsaco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes\\r\\naco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which\\r\\nworks as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the\\r\\nlocal optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based\\r\\napproach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-\\r\\ning the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-\\r\\ncreases the power of the collective information of the search space\\r\\nand guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles\\r\\nremain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based\\r\\nmechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-\\r\\nstraints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,\\r\\nafter decreasing the movements of particles, the search process\\r\\nstops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-\\r\\ncrete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-\\r\\nmula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the\\r\\nperformance of the presented method. dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-\\r\\nration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves\\r\\nthe performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches\\r\\n(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains\\r\\nthe desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-\\r\\nber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the\\r\\nnumber of iterations gradually abates the power of the random\\r\\nsearch factor and increases the power of the collective information\\r\\nfactor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role\\r\\nin rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding\\r\\nthe exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-\\r\\nnate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a\\r\\nnew terminating criterion in this paper. four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of\\r\\nthe dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results\\r\\nof these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained\\r\\nby other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate\\r\\nthe robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads\\r\\nto better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and\\r\\nhigh convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the\\r\\noptimization time and the number of analyses are related to each\\r\\nother directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization\\r\\nproblems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm\\r\\nit can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic\\r\\nalgorithm. talatahari / journal of constructional steel research 65 (2009) 1558–1568\\r\\nacknowledgement\\r\\nthe first author is grateful to iran national science foundation\\r\\nfor support.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",
