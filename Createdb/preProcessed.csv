structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:
xk+

3( rk

)
(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.
4.1. a 25-bar spatial truss
the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress

in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±

(±

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0
kg/
m3
and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

to be 200 for compression members according to asd-aisc [13]

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22.
06

, while it is
22.
39
m3
for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

abstract
in this paper, a particle swarm optimizer with passive congregation (psopc), ant colony optimization
(aco) and harmony search scheme (hs) are combined to reach to an efficient algorithm, called discrete
heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (dhpsaco). this method is then employed to optimize
truss structures with discrete variables. the dhpsaco applies a psopc for global optimization and the ant
colony approach for local search, similar to its continuous version. the problem-specific constraints are
handled using a modified feasible-based mechanism, and the harmony search scheme is employed to deal
with variable constraints. some design examples are tested using the new method and their results are
compared to those of pso, psopc and hpso algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present
method.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1

to the current position
xk

as follows:

where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better

smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

pitch adjusting process is performed only after a value is chosen
from
pk
i
. the value (1-par) sets the rate of doing nothing. a par
(pitch adjusting rate) of 0.1 indicates that the algorithm will choose
a neighboring value with 10%

hmcr probability.
if
a∗
controls the exactitude of the solutions with a reverse
relation, the terminating criterion is defined as continuing the
search process until the absolute value of the particles’ velocity is
less than

is a function which rounds each elements of x to

formula, the agents will be permitted to select discrete values.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may reduce the
exploration in the algorithm. therefore, in order to increase the
exploration, in this paper the velocity of particles is redefined as

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,
a∗
is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.
4.1. a 25-bar spatial truss
the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been

(2767.

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are

(±
275.80 mpa). all nodes
in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±
8.89 mm) imposed on every node in every
direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,
(7) a 27–a 30, (8) a 31–a 36, (9) a 37–a 39, (10) a 40–a 43, (11) a 44–a 49,
and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0
kg/
m3
and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).
4.3. a 72-bar spatial truss
for the 72-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 5, the
material density is
0.
1
lb/ in.
3
(2767.
990
kg/
m3
) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

a 59–a

two optimization cases are implemented.

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1

,
to the current position
xk

as follows:
xk+

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

is the exploration coefficient; r

rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,

is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,

and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.
0
kg/
m3
and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected
to the stress limits of
±
25 ksi
(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of
±
0.25 in.
(±
0.635 cm).
the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is

these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v

distributed in the range of (0, 1); c

constants; c

pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk

)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

although this change is simple and efficient, it may reduce the

where c

is the exploration coefficient; r

is a uniformly distributed
random number in the range of (0, 1); and
rdk
is a vector generated
randomly from the search domain.
for the dhpsaco algorithm,
a∗
is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

(2767.

modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are

(±

in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±

direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.
case 1: the discrete variables are selected from the set d

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from the american
institute of steel construction (aisc) code [13], listed in table 1.

table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

rdk
is a vector generated

for the dhpsaco algorithm,

is equal to the minimum value
of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

the 25-bar spatial truss structure shown in fig. 1 has been
studied by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the material density is

(2767.

) and the
modulus of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the stress
limitations of the members are
±
40 kpsi
(±
275.80 mpa). all nodes
in three directions are subjected to displacement limitations of
±
0.35 inch (in.)
(±
8.89 mm) imposed on every node in every
direction. the structure includes 25 members, which are divided
into eight groups, as follows: (1) a 1, (2) a 2–a 5, (3) a 6–a 9, (4)
a 10–a 11, (5) a 12–a 13, (6) a 14–a 17, (7) a 18–a

and (8) a 22–a 25. two
optimization cases are implemented.

institute of steel construction (aisc) code [13], listed in table 1.

in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,

and p

=

selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the

4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is

the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

structural optimization has become one of the most active
branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1].
recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries.
an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4].
in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i.e. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section.
although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term.
there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6].
the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism.
several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper.
2. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search.
the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration.
the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1
i
,
to the current position
xk
i
as follows:
xk+

i
= xk

3( rk

(3)
where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c
3
is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm.
the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2].
then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space.
particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

rule 1: any feasible solution is preferred to any infeasible solution.
rule 2: infeasible solutions containing slight violation of the
constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions.

52-bar truss structure.
rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred.
rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred.
by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability.
if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

of the difference between cross-sectional areas of two successive
discrete sections.
4. numerical examples
in this section, some truss optimization examples with discrete
variables are optimized with the proposed method. the final
results are compared to the solutions of other methods to demon-
strate the efficiency of the present approach.
for the proposed algorithm, a population of 50 individuals is
used for both particles and ants; the value of constants c
1
and c
2
are
set 0.8 and the passive congregation coefficient c
3
is taken as 0.6.
the value of inertia weight decreases linearly from 0.9 in the first
iteration to 0.4 in the last iteration [2]. the amount of step size
(η
)
in the aco stage is recommended as 0.01 [5]. the value of hmcr
is set to 0.95 and that of par is taken as 0.10 [2]. the algorithms
are coded in matlab and structures are analyzed using the direct
stiffness method.

algorithms. the dhpsaco algorithm achieves the optimum design
in less than 100 iterations, and it has high convergence rate in the
first iterations compared to the other algorithms. tables 3 and 4
list the optimal values of the eight size variables obtained in this
research for case 1 and case 2, respectively.
4.2. a 52-bar planar truss
the 52-bar planar truss structure shown in fig. 3 has been
analyzed by wu and chow [10], lee and geem [11] and li et al. [12].
the members of this structure are divided into 12 groups: (1)
a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 10, (3) a 11–a 13, (4) a 14–a 17, (5) a 18–a 23, (6) a 24–a 26,

and (12) a 50–a 52. the material density is
7860.

and the
modulus of elasticity is
2. 07× 105
mpa. the members are subjected
to stress limitations of
±
180 mpa. both of the loads, p
x
=
100 kn
and p
y
=
200 kn, are considered. the discrete variables are
selected from table 1.
table 5 and fig. 4 provide the comparison of optimal design
results and convergence rates of 52-bar planar truss structure,
respectively. from table 5 and fig. 4, it can be observed that
pso and the psopc cannot find a good result, while the hpso
and dhpsaco algorithms achieve good optimal results. however,
hpso needs more than 2000 iterations to reach a good solution
while dhpsaco finds the optimum result in 212 iterations (5300
analyses).

) and the modulus
of elasticity is 10,000 ksi (68,950 mpa). the members are subjected

±

(±
172.375 mpa). the nodes are
subjected to the displacement limits of

(±

the 72 structural members of this spatial truss are sorted into
16 groups using symmetry: (1) a 1–a 4, (2) a 5–a 12, (3) a 13–a 16,
(4) a 17–a 18, (5) a 19–a 22, (6) a 23–a 30, (7) a 31–a 34, (8) a 35–a 36, (9)

case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss.
in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco.
in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. fig. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. 7. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the
literature.

fig. 9. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco.
4.4. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower.
a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. [14]. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22.

, while it is

for the pso algorithm.
the design history graph is shown in fig. 9. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14].
fig. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. (8 cm),
2.9881 in. (7.59 cm) and 0.9258 in. (2.35 cm), respectively. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure.
5. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method.
dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper.
four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm.

branches of structural engineering in the last decade. the large
number of design variables, large size of the search space and
the control of a great number of design constraints are major
preventive factors in performing optimum design in a reasonable
time. despite these facts, designers and owners have always
desired to have optimal structures [1]. recently, authors have presented an efficient continuous
optimization algorithm, so-called heuristic particle swarm ant
colony optimization (hpsaco) [2], for truss problems, which
is low time consuming and highly reliable. in hpsaco, the
psopc algorithm (a hybrid pso with passive congregation [3])
is combined with the ant colony algorithm and harmony search
approach. the hpsaco applies the psopc for global optimization
and an ant colony approach is employed as a local search,
wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided mechanism to update
the positions found by the particles in the earlier stage. harmony
search (hs) works as a handling approach to deal with variable
boundaries. an optimization problem can be considered either as a
continuous problem or a discrete one. in continuous problems, the
design variables can vary continuously in the optimization; while

iran. if the design variables represent a selection from a set of parts,
the problem is considered discrete. hpsaco, similar to pso and
the psopc, is a continuous approach, while in practical structural
optimization problems industrial cross-sections are used which
have discrete values, and as a result a discrete solution is better
than a continuous one for this kind of optimization problems [4]. in order to reach a discrete version of hpsaco (i. dhpsaco),
some changes should be made to the continuous algorithm. in
the discrete method, agents are allowed to select discrete values
from the permissible list of cross-sections, and if any one of agents
selects another value for a design variable, the dhpsaco changes
its magnitude by the value of the nearest discrete cross-section. although this change is simple and efficient, it may however
reduce the exploration of the algorithm. therefore, the formula for
the particles’ velocity should be improved by adding an exploration
term. there are some constraints in truss optimization problems
that should be carefully handled. a number of approaches have
been proposed by incorporating constraint-handling techniques to
solve constrained optimization problems [5]. the most common
approach adopted to deal with constrained search spaces is the
use of penalty functions. when using a penalty function, the
amount of constraint violation is used to punish or penalize an
infeasible solution so that feasible solutions are favored by the
selection process. despite the popularity of penalty functions,
there are several drawbacks associated with this method. the main
drawback is the requirement of a careful tuning of the penalty
factors for accurate estimation of the degree of penalization to
be applied in order to approach the feasible region efficiently [6]. the separation of constraints and objectives is another approach

fig. comparison of the convergence rates of the pso-based algorithms for the 25-bar truss structure. to deal with constrained search spaces. in this method the idea
is to avoid the combination of the value of the objective function
and the constraints of a problem to assign fitness, like when
using a penalty function [6,7]. the feasible-based constrained
approach [7] is used for separation of constraints and objective
methods; it is a sufficiently powerful and reliable approach and it
has been employed by many researches. in this paper, the problem-
specified constraints are handled by using a modified feasible-
based mechanism. several design examples with discrete design variables are
tested using the new method, and their results are compared
to those of the pso, psopc, hpso and some other heuristic
algorithms. the remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. the problem formulation is given in section 2. section 3
describes the hpsaco algorithm and its discrete version. section 4
contains several illustrative examples, and section 5 concludes the
paper. discrete optimum design problem of truss structures
size optimization of truss structures involves arriving at
optimum values of the member cross-section, d i, that minimize
the structural weight w . this minimum design also has to
satisfy inequality constraints that limit design variable sizes and
structural responses [8]. thus, the discrete optimal design problem
of truss structures may be expressed as

3. heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization for truss
structures
3.1. review of continuous hpsaco
the heuristic particle swarm ant colony optimization (hpsaco)
algorithm applies a psopc for global optimization, while aco
works as a local search, wherein ants apply a pheromone-guided
mechanism to refine the positions found by particles in the psopc
stage [2]. in hpsaco, a simple pheromone-guided mechanism of
aco is proposed and employed for the local search. the psopc stage involves a number of particles, which are
initialized randomly in the feasible space. these particles fly
through the search space and their positions are updated based on
the best positions of individual particles, the best position among
all particles in the search space, and the position of a particle
selected randomly from the swarm in each iteration. the update moves a particle by adding a velocity change, v
k+ 1

,
to the current position

as follows:

where
ω
is an inertia weight to control the influence of the previous
velocity; r 1, r
2
and r
3
are three random numbers uniformly
distributed in the range of (0, 1); c
1
and c
2
are two acceleration
constants; c

is the passive congregation coefficient;
pk
i
is the best
position of the ith particle up to iteration k;
pk
g
is the best position
among all particles in the swarm up to iteration k; and r
i
is a
particle selected randomly from the swarm. the aco stage handles p ants equal to the number of particles in
the psopc [2], and each ant generates a solution around
pk
g
which
can be expressed as
zk
i
= n( pk
g
, σ )
(4)
where
zk
i
is the solution constructed by ant i in the stage k;
n(
pk
g
, σ )
denotes a random number normally distributed with mean value
pk
g
and variance
σ
, where
σ = (
a
max
−
a
min) × η
(5)
η
is the step size. the aco stage in the hpsaco algorithm works as
a helping factor to guide the exploration and to increase the control
in the exploitation [2]. then, the value of the objective function for each ant, f
(
zk
i
)
, is
computed and the current position of ant i,
zk
i
, is replaced with the
position
xk
i
, the current position of particle i in the swarm, if f
(
xk
i
)
is bigger than f
(
zk
i
)
and current ant is in the feasible space. particles in the search space may violate either the problem-
specific constraints or the limits of the variables. in this paper, a
modified feasible-based mechanism is used to handle the problem-
specific constraints which consists of the following four rules:

constraints (from 0.01 in the first iteration to 0.001 in the last
iteration) are considered as feasible solutions. comparison of the convergence rates of the pso-based algorithms for the
52-bar truss structure. rule 3: between two feasible solutions, the one having the better
objective function value is preferred. rule 4: between two infeasible solutions, the one having the
smaller sum of constraint violation is preferred. by using the first and fourth rules, the search tends to the
feasible region rather than infeasible region, and by employing
the third rule the search tends to the feasible region with good
solutions [9]. for most structural optimization problems, the global
minimum locates on or close to the boundary of a feasible design
space. by applying rule 2, the particles approach the boundaries
and can fly to the global minimum with a great probability. if particles fly out of the variable boundaries, the solutions
cannot be used even if the problem-specific constraints are
satisfied. although minimizing the maximum value of the velocity
can make fewer particles violate the variable boundaries, it may
also prevent the particles from crossing the problem-specific
constraints and can cause a reduction in exploration. using the
harmony search-based handling approach, this problem is dealt
with. according to this mechanism, any component of the solution
vector (particle) violating the variable boundaries can be generated

(a) 3d view. case 2: the discrete variables are selected from table 1. table 6
lists the values and directions of the two load cases applied to the
72-bar spatial truss. in case 1, the best weight of the dhpsaco algorithm is
385.54 lb (174.88 kg), while it is 388.94 lb (176.42 kg), 387.94 lb
(175.97 kg), 400.66 lb (181.74 kg) for the hpso [12], hs [11],
and ga [10], respectively. for the pso and psopc algorithms,
these algorithms do not get optimal results when the maximum
number of iterations is reached [12]. the hpso algorithm gets
the optimal solution after 1000 iterations [12] (50,000 analyses)
while it takes just 213 iterations (5,330 analyses) for dhpsaco. in case 2, dhpsaco finds the best result while other pso-
based algorithms could not reach an optimum design [12]. the
displacement constraints are active in this case. 6 compares
the allowable and existing displacements of the nodes for the
dhpsaco result. the convergence history for this example is
shown in fig. tables 7 and 8 compare the results of the dhpsaco
algorithm to those of the previously reported methods in the

(in. convergence history for the 582-bar truss structure using dhpsaco. a 582-bar tower truss
the 582-bar tower truss with the height of 80 m, shown in
fig. 8, is chosen from [14] as the last example. the symmetry of
the tower around x-axis and y-axis is considered to group the 582
members into 32 independent size variables. a single load case is
considered such that it consists of lateral loads of 5.0 kn (1.12 kips)
applied in both x- and y-directions and a vertical load of
−
30 kn
(−
6.74 kips) applied in the z-direction at all nodes of the tower. a discrete set of 137 economical standard steel sections selected
from w-shape profile list based on area and radii of gyration
properties is used to size the variables [14]. the lower and upper
bounds on size variables are taken as

direction. (c) displacement in the z-direction. pso has obtained the lightest design compared to some other
meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolution strategies, simulated
annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, harmony search
and genetic algorithms reported by hasançebi et al. evolution
strategies technique gives the second good answer, which is
only 0.1% heavier than the result of pso. the other minimum
weights obtained by simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony
optimization, harmony search and genetic algorithm are 0.4%,
1.2%, 1.7%, 3.8% and 5.7% heavier than the one attained by pso,
respectively [14]. table 9 gives the best solution vectors of the pso
and dhpsaco algorithms. the optimum result of the dhpsaco
approach is
22. the design history graph is shown in fig. dhpsaco needs nearly
8500 analyses to reach a solution, which is significantly less than
50,000 analyses for pso [14]. 10 compares the allowable and existing stress ratio and
displacement values of the dhpsaco. the maximum values of
displacements in the x-, y- and z-directions are 3.1498 in. the
maximum stress ratio is 93.06%, as shown in the figure. concluding remarks
a combinational discrete optimization approach, called dhp-
saco, is developed for optimal design of trusses. dhpsaco utilizes
aco as an auxiliary tool to improve the psopc algorithm which
works as a global search. aco does extra exploitation around the
local optimums obtained by particles. a harmony search-based
approach is utilized to handle the variable constraints. by increas-
ing the number of iterations, the harmony search gradually in-
creases the power of the collective information of the search space
and guides the exploration process. in order to make the particles
remain in the feasible space, an efficient modified feasible-based
mechanism is introduced which handles the problem-specific con-
straints. here, the terminating criterion is defined in a way that,
after decreasing the movements of particles, the search process
stops. in the dhpsaco method, agents are allowed to select dis-
crete values from the permissible list of cross-sections. a new for-
mula for the velocity of particles is also introduced to improve the
performance of the presented method. dhpsaco by increasing the exploitation, guiding the explo-
ration and utilizing an efficient terminating criterion improves
the performance of the algorithm. dhpsaco does extra searches
(exploitation) around the local optimums, and therefore obtains
the desirable solution with higher probability and a smaller num-
ber of iterations. in the heuristic methods, the increase in the
number of iterations gradually abates the power of the random
search factor and increases the power of the collective information
factor. in dhpsaco, the aco and hs stages play an auxiliary role
in rapidly increasing the collective information factor and guiding
the exploration. using an efficient terminating criterion can elimi-
nate additional unnecessary iterations. this goal is fulfilled using a
new terminating criterion in this paper. four truss structures are considered to verify the efficiency of
the dhpsaco algorithm. the comparisons of the numerical results
of these trusses using the dhpsaco method with those obtained
by other pso-based approaches are performed to demonstrate
the robustness of the present algorithm. dhpsaco not only leads
to better solutions but also utilizes less computational time and
high convergence speed compared to other algorithms. since the
optimization time and the number of analyses are related to each
other directly for the heuristic algorithm in structural optimization
problems, from the number of analyses for the dhpsaco algorithm
it can be concluded that dhpsaco is faster than other heuristic
algorithm. talatahari / journal of constructional steel research 65 (2009) 1558–1568
